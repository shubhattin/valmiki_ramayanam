    I will be giving you Sanskrit shloka along with its English translation for Valmiki Ramayanam. Generate a text prompt which can be used to generate consistent looking images that encapsulate the essence of the translations(meaning). Make the images look real along with the background. The scene should be set in the Treta Yuga(Ancient India in times of Valmiki Ramayanam). Keep People's faces and clothes in Ancient Indian Context.

    To create consistent image prompts that encapsulate the essence of the translations from Valmiki Ramayanam, I will aim to generate a detailed, descriptive prompt based on the meaning and context of each shloka. These prompts will focus on the visual elements of the scene described in the translation, while keeping the artistic and cultural essence intact.

    Feel free to provide the shloka and translation when you're ready, and I'll start generating a suitable image prompt for it.
