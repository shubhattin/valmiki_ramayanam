**Chapter Title** : Exploration of the Kandu Forest

Hanuman, along with Tara and Angada, sets out to search for Sita as instructed by Sugriva. They explore the dense forests and caves of the Vindhya mountains. Despite their efforts, they do not find Sita. The forest is vast, deserted, and difficult to search. They encounter a demon, mistaking him for Ravana, and Angada defeats him. The search continues, but they remain unsuccessful and disheartened.
