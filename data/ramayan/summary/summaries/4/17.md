## रामाधिक्षेपः (rAmAdhikShEpaH)
**Chapter Title** : Rama's Reproach

Rama shoots Vali with an arrow, causing him to fall like a tree. Vali, adorned with golden ornaments, lies on the ground, still retaining his strength and glory. The earth seems dull without Vali's presence, like the sky without the moon. Despite being struck, Vali's body and spirit remain radiant. The divine garland given by Indra sustains Vali's life and energy. Rama and Lakshmana approach the fallen Vali, who questions Rama's actions. Vali accuses Rama of acting against dharma by attacking him from hiding. He argues that Rama's actions are unjust and questions his adherence to righteousness. Vali expresses regret for not heeding Tara's advice and acknowledges his fate. He challenges Rama's sense of justice and questions the morality of his actions.
