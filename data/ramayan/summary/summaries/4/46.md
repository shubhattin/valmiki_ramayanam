## भूमण्डलभ्रमणकथनम् (bhUmaNDalabhramaNakathanam)
**Chapter Title** : The Tale of the Earth's Circumambulation

Rama asks Sugriva how he knows the entire earth. Sugriva explains that when Vali chased a demon into a cave, he waited outside for a year. Thinking Vali was dead, Sugriva sealed the cave and returned to Kishkindha. Sugriva became king but Vali returned, defeated the demon, and reclaimed the throne. Sugriva fled, chased by Vali, and saw many lands and rivers. Hanuman reminded Sugriva of a sage's curse on Vali, which protected them in Rishyamuka. Sugriva realized the earth's vastness during his escape.
