## संपातिपक्षप्ररोहः (sampAtipakShaprarOhaH)
**Chapter Title** : The Growth of Sampati's Wings

Sampati, a wise speaker, praises and bids farewell to the monkeys before entering his cave. He waits on Mount Vindhya, recalling the sage's words for over a hundred years. As the moon sets, he feels tormented by many thoughts. He decides against death, remembering the sage's advice to preserve his life. His regained wings dispel his sorrow like fire dispels darkness. He wonders why his son couldn't save Sita despite threats. Sampati's wings grow back, bringing him immense joy. He urges the monkeys to strive to find Sita, as his wing recovery signifies their success. The monkeys, inspired, set out in the direction of the constellation Abhijit to search for Sita.
