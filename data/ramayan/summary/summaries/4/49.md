## रजतपर्वतविचयः (rajataparvatavichayaH)
**Chapter Title** : Exploration of the Silver Mountain

Angada encourages the monkeys to continue searching for Sita. They have explored forests, mountains, and caves but haven't found her. Time is running out, and Sugriva's orders are strict. Angada urges them to overcome fatigue and keep searching. Gandhamadana supports Angada's words. The monkeys resume their search in the southern direction. They climb the Silver Mountain but don't find Sita. Exhausted, they rest briefly before continuing their search.
