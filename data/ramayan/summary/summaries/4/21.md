## हनुमदाश्वासनम् (hanumadAshvAsanam)
**Chapter Title** : Hanuman Consoles Tara

Hanuman gently consoles Tara, who is grieving like a fallen star. He explains that everyone faces the results of their actions, good or bad. Hanuman advises Tara to focus on her son Angada's future. He reminds her that life is transient, like bubbles. Hanuman suggests that Angada should be crowned as king. Tara, still in sorrow, responds that Sugriva, Angada's uncle, should handle the kingdom's affairs. She expresses her desire to stay with her fallen husband, Vali.
