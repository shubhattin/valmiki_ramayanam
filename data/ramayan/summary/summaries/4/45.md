## वानरबलप्रतिष्ठा (vAnarabalapratiShThA)
**Chapter Title** : Establishment of the Monkey Army

Sugriva, the monkey king, gathered all the monkeys to help Rama. He instructed them to search for Sita. The monkeys covered the earth like locusts and set out in all directions. Rama stayed at Prasravana with Lakshmana, waiting for a month. The monkeys, led by their chiefs, went to the north, east, south, and west. They were determined to find Sita and defeat Ravana. Each monkey boasted of their strength and vowed to bring back Sita.
