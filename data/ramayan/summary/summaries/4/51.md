## स्वयम्प्रभातिथ्यम् (svayamprabhAtithyam)
**Chapter Title** : Hospitality of Svayamprabha

Hanuman and his companions enter a dark cave, exhausted and thirsty. They are amazed by the golden trees and beautiful surroundings. They meet a pious ascetic woman, Svayamprabha, who explains the magical nature of the place. She tells them about the powerful demon architect Maya who created the golden forest. Maya was killed by Indra, and the forest was gifted to the apsara Hema by Brahma. Svayamprabha, Hema's friend, guards the place. She offers them food and water and asks about their journey.
