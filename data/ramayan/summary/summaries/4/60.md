## संपातिपुरावृत्तवर्णनम् (sampAtipurAvRttavarNanam)
**Chapter Title** : Description of Sampaati's Past

The monkeys, led by Angada, gather around the vulture Sampaati on a beautiful mountain. Sampaati, feeling hopeful, begins to speak about Sita. He recalls falling on the Vindhya mountain, burned by the sun's rays. After six days, he regained consciousness and observed the surroundings. He identified the mountain as Vindhya, near the southern ocean. There was a revered hermitage of the sage Nishakara. Sampaati, once visited by Jatayu, sought the sage. The sage, recognizing Sampaati, asked about his burnt wings and past.
