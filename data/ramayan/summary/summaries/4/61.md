## सूर्यानुगमनाख्यानम् (sUryAnugamanAkhyAnam)
**Chapter Title** : The Pursuit of the Sun

Two warriors, including Jatayu, attempted a difficult task of following the sun. They flew high into the sky, witnessing various cities and landscapes below. The journey was exhausting, causing them to sweat and fear. They lost their sense of direction and felt as if the world was ending. Jatayu fell to the ground, and the other warrior followed, protecting Jatayu with his wings. Both were injured, and the warrior contemplated ending his life.
