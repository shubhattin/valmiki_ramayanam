## बिलप्रवेशकारणकथनम् (bilapravEshakAraNakathanam)
**Chapter Title** : The Reason for Entering the Cave

The sage-like woman asks the monkey leaders if they are rested and ready to share their story. Hanuman begins to narrate the tale of Rama, who entered the Dandaka forest with his brother Lakshmana and wife Sita. Sita was abducted by Ravana, and the monkeys were sent by their king Sugriva to find her. The monkeys, tired and hungry, discover a hidden cave and enter it. Inside, they meet the sage-like woman who offers them fruits and roots. Hanuman requests her help to exit the cave as they are running out of time to fulfill their mission. The woman uses her powers to guide them out, and they continue their journey.
