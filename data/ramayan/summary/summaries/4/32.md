**Chapter Title** : Hanuman's Counsel

Sugriva hears Angada's words and learns about Lakshmana's anger. He is puzzled about why Lakshmana is upset, as he believes he has done nothing wrong. Sugriva suspects that his enemies have misled Lakshmana. Hanuman advises Sugriva to remember Rama's help in defeating Vali. Hanuman suggests that Lakshmana's anger is due to Sugriva's negligence in preparing for the mission. He urges Sugriva to appease Lakshmana by showing respect and humility. Hanuman warns that Rama's power is immense and should not be underestimated.
