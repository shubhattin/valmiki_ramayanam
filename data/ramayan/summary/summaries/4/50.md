## ऋक्षबिलप्रवेशः (RkShabilapravEshaH)
**Chapter Title** : Entry into the Bear's Cave

Hanuman, along with Tara and Angada, searches the Vindhya mountains. They explore caves inhabited by lions and tigers. The region is difficult to search due to dense forests and caves. They find a large cave named RkShabila, guarded by a demon. Exhausted and thirsty, they enter the cave. Inside, they discover a beautiful, illuminated area with golden trees and precious stones. They see a woman in ascetic attire, glowing with energy. Hanuman respectfully asks her identity and about the cave.
