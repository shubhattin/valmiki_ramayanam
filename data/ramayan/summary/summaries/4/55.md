## प्रायोपवेशः (prAyOpavEshaH)
**Chapter Title** : Vow of Fasting unto Death

Angada, after hearing Hanuman's respectful and righteous words, speaks about Sugriva's lack of virtues like stability, purity, and courage. He criticizes Sugriva for taking his brother's wife and forgetting his promise to Rama. Angada doubts Sugriva's intentions and fears for his own life, feeling abandoned and powerless. He decides to fast unto death, asking the monkeys to return home and convey his respects to his family. The monkeys, moved by Angada's decision, join him in his vow, expressing their despair and fear of Rama's wrath.
