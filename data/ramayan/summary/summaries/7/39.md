## वानरप्रीणनम् (vAnaraprINanam)
**Chapter Title** : Pleasing the Vanaras

The kings, with their armies, joyfully returned home after the war. They praised Rama's strength and were grateful for his protection. The kings offered gifts to Rama as a token of gratitude. Rama distributed these gifts to Sugriva, Vibhishana, and the Vanaras. Rama praised Hanuman and Angada for their loyalty and bravery. The Vanaras and Rakshasas enjoyed their time in Ayodhya. Rama spent two happy months with his allies, celebrating their victory.
