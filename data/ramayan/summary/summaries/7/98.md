## रामकोपोपशमः (rAmakOpOpashamaH)
**Chapter Title** : The Pacification of Rama's Anger

Sita enters the netherworld, causing grief among the Vanaras and sages. Rama is deeply saddened and angry, lamenting Sita's loss. He demands the earth to return Sita or threatens destruction. Brahma, with other gods, advises Rama to remember his divine origin and assures him of a future reunion with Sita in heaven. Brahma reveals that Valmiki will narrate the rest of Rama's story. The sages, eager to hear the future events, are granted permission by Brahma. Rama, after hearing Brahma's words, requests Valmiki to continue the narration. The night passes as Rama mourns Sita.
