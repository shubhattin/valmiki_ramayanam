## ययातिशापः (yayAtishApaH)
**Chapter Title** : Curse of Yayati

Rama speaks to Lakshmana about an ancient story involving King Nimi and Sage Vasistha. Nimi, a brave Kshatriya, disrespected Vasistha, leading to a significant event. Lakshmana listens to Rama's words, acknowledging that not all men can show patience. The story shifts to King Yayati, who had two wives, Sharmishtha and Devayani. Sharmishtha bore Puru, and Devayani bore Yadu. Devayani's son Yadu felt neglected and expressed his sorrow to his mother. Devayani, upset, called upon her father, Sage Shukracharya, who cursed King Yayati to old age. Shukracharya then comforted his daughter and returned home.
