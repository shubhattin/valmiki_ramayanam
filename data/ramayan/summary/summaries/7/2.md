## पौलस्योत्पत्तिः (paulasyOtpattiH)
**Chapter Title** : The Birth of Pulastya

Rama listens to the story of Pulastya's lineage and his great power. Pulastya, a revered sage, was the son of Prajapati and lived near Mount Meru. He performed penance, but was disturbed by celestial maidens. Angered, he cursed that any maiden who approached him would bear a child. Trinabindu's daughter unknowingly approached Pulastya and was affected by the curse. Her father offered her to Pulastya, who accepted her as his wife. Pleased with her virtues, Pulastya blessed her with a son, Vishrava, who became a renowned sage.
