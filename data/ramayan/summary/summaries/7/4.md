**Chapter Title** : The Origin of Ravana and Other Early Rakshasas

Rama is curious about the origin of Rakshasas in Lanka. Agastya explains that Rakshasas were created by Prajapati. Heti and Praheti were the first Rakshasa leaders. Heti married Bhaya and had a son, Vidyutkesa. Vidyutkesa married Sandhya's daughter. Their child was abandoned but found by Shiva and Parvati. Shiva blessed the child, named Sukesha, with immortality. Sukesha grew powerful and ruled from a flying city.
