**Chapter Title** : Victory over Varuna

Ravana, after defeating Yama, is praised by his allies. He travels to the underworld, defeating serpents and demons. He challenges the invincible Nivatakavachas to battle. The fierce battle lasts a year without a winner. Brahma intervenes, suggesting friendship. Ravana forms an alliance with them. He then explores the underworld, defeating the Kalakeyas. Ravana encounters Varuna's sons and defeats them in battle. Varuna is absent, having gone to Brahma's realm. Ravana, satisfied, returns to Lanka.
