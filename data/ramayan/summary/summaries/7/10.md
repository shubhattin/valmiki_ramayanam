## रावणादिवरदानम् (rAvaNAdivaradAnam)
**Chapter Title** : Boons to Ravana and Others

Rama asks sage Agastya about the penance of Ravana's brothers. Agastya describes their intense penance. Kumbhakarna performed severe penance for ten thousand years. Vibhishana stood on one leg for five thousand years. Ravana performed penance for ten thousand years, offering his heads to the fire. Brahma, pleased with their penance, grants them boons. Ravana asks for invincibility against gods and demons. Vibhishana asks for unwavering righteousness. Kumbhakarna, influenced by Saraswati, asks for long sleep. Brahma grants their wishes, and they return to Lanka.
