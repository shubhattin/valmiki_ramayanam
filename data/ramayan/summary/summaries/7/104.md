## पितामहवाक्यकथनम् (pitAmahavAkyakathanam)
**Chapter Title** : The Words of the Grandfather

The chapter begins with a divine messenger sent by the Grandfather, Brahma, to speak to Rama. The messenger reveals that he was once Rama's son in a previous life, created by illusion. Brahma reminds Rama of his duty to protect the worlds. In the past, Rama created two powerful beings, Madhu and Kaitabha, whose bones formed the earth. Brahma was born from a lotus and entrusted with creation. Rama, as Vishnu, took human form to defeat Ravana. Now, the time has come for Rama to return to his divine form. Rama decides to fulfill his purpose and return to the divine realm.
