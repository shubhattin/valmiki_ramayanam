## इन्द्रपराजयकारणकथनम् (indraparAjayakAraNakathanam)
**Chapter Title** : The Reason for Indra's Defeat

Ravana's son, Indrajit, defeats Indra, the king of gods. Prajapati praises Indrajit's valor and grants him a boon. Indrajit asks for immortality, but Prajapati explains it's impossible. Instead, Indrajit is granted invincibility during a specific ritual. Indra is reminded of his past misdeeds involving Ahalya. Indra is advised to perform a Vishnu Yajna to regain his position. Indra's son is safe, and Indra returns to heaven after the ritual.
