**Chapter Title** : Coronation of Puru, Establishment of Dogs, Granting of Sarvarthasiddha, Dispute between Vultures and Owls

King Nahusha's son, Yayati, becomes old and asks his son Yadu to take his old age. Yadu refuses, suggesting Puru instead. Puru accepts his father's old age willingly. Yayati regains his youth and rules for many years. Later, Yayati returns his old age to Puru and blesses him. Yayati curses Yadu for disobedience, predicting a troubled lineage. Puru is crowned king and rules righteously. Yadu's descendants become outcasts, living in the forest.
