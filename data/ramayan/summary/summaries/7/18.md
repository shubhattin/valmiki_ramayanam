## मरुत्तविजयः (maruttavijayaH)
**Chapter Title** : Victory over Marutta

Ravana, after entering the fire with Vedavati, travels the world on his Pushpaka Vimana. He sees King Marutta performing a sacrifice with gods. The sage Samvarta, brother of Brihaspati, conducts the sacrifice. Gods, fearing Ravana, take animal forms. Ravana challenges Marutta to a fight. Marutta, advised by Samvarta, refrains from fighting. Ravana claims victory and leaves. Gods return to their forms and bless the animals they became. Indra blesses the peacock, Yama blesses the crow, Varuna blesses the swan, and Kubera blesses the chameleon.
