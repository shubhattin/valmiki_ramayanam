## निमिनिमीषीकरणम् (niminimIShIkaraNam)
**Chapter Title** : The Blinking of Nimi

Lakshmana is pleased to hear a divine story and asks Rama about the rebirth of two sages. Rama narrates the story of Vasistha's previous life. Vasistha was born from the energy of Mitra and Varuna. King Ikshvaku chose Vasistha as his priest. The sages performed a ritual for King Nimi, whose body was preserved. The gods granted Nimi's wish to reside in the eyes of all beings. The sages created a son for Nimi from a fire ritual, named Janaka. Thus, the lineage of Mithila was established.
