## शम्बूकविचयः (shambUkavichayaH)
**Chapter Title** : Shambuka's Demise

Rama hears Narada's words and feels great joy. He instructs Lakshmana to comfort a Brahmin and preserve a child's body. Rama calls for the Pushpaka Vimana and sets out to find the cause of a Brahmin boy's death. He travels in all directions, searching for any wrongdoing. In the south, he finds a sage performing severe penance. Rama approaches the sage and inquires about his caste and purpose. The sage, Shambuka, reveals he is a Shudra seeking heaven through penance. Rama, realizing this is the cause of the boy's death, beheads Shambuka. The Brahmin boy is revived, and Rama returns to Ayodhya.
