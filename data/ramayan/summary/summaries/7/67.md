**Chapter Title** : The Slaying of Mandhata

Shatrughna asks sage Chyavana about Lavana's strength. Chyavana narrates the story of King Mandhata, who tried to conquer the heavens. Indra warns Mandhata about Lavana, a demon defying his rule on earth. Mandhata sends a messenger to Lavana, who is killed by the demon. Enraged, Mandhata attacks Lavana but is killed by Lavana's powerful spear. Chyavana assures Shatrughna that he will defeat Lavana the next day. Shatrughna is advised to attack Lavana when he is unarmed for assured victory.
