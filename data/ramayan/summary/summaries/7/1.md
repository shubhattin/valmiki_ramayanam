## रामप्रश्नः (rAmaprashnaH)
**Chapter Title** : Rama's Inquiry

Rama, having established his rule and defeated the demons, is visited by sages. These sages, including Agastya and others from different directions, come to congratulate him. They praise Rama for defeating Ravana and his powerful demon allies. The sages express their amazement at Rama's victory over Indrajit, Ravana's son, who was considered invincible. Rama humbly questions the sages about Indrajit's powers and how he surpassed his father, Ravana. The sages are impressed by Rama's humility and willingness to learn.
