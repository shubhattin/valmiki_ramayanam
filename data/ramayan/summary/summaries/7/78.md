## आभरणागमः (AbharaNAgamaH)
**Chapter Title** : Arrival of the Ornaments

The sage narrates his past life to Rama, explaining his journey of joy and sorrow. He was the son of a famous king named Sudheva. After his father's death, he ruled the kingdom righteously for many years. Later, he renounced the world and went to the forest for penance. Despite reaching the heavenly realm, he suffered from hunger and thirst. Brahma advised him to consume his own body for sustenance. He did so for many years until the sage Agastya arrived and freed him from this suffering. The sage offered divine ornaments to Agastya in gratitude, which were later given to Rama.
