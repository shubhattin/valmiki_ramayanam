**Chapter Title** : Abandonment of Lakshmana

Lakshmana, with a heavy heart, tells Rama not to grieve for him. He insists that Rama must keep his promise to the sage Durvasa. Lakshmana urges Rama to abandon him to uphold dharma. Rama, distressed, consults his ministers and sages. Sage Vasistha advises Rama to fulfill his vow to protect the world. Rama reluctantly agrees and tells Lakshmana of his decision. Lakshmana leaves for the Sarayu River, where he ends his life. The gods honor Lakshmana as he ascends to heaven.
