## भद्रवाक्यश्रवणम् (bhadravAkyashravaNam)
**Chapter Title** : Hearing of Bhadra's Words

King Rama is surrounded by wise jesters who entertain him with various stories. Rama inquires about the stories circulating in the city and among the people. Bhadra, a jester, informs Rama that people often talk about his victory over Ravana. Rama asks Bhadra to tell him everything the people say, both good and bad. Bhadra reports that people question how Rama accepted Sita back after her abduction by Ravana. They wonder if they should follow Rama's example in their own lives. Rama is deeply troubled by these words and discusses them with his friends.
