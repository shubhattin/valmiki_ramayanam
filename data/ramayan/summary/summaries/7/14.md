## यक्षरक्षोयुद्धम् (yakSharakShOyuddham)
**Chapter Title** : Yaksha-Rakshasa Battle

Ravana, with his six powerful ministers, sets out in anger, appearing to burn the world. He quickly reaches Mount Kailasa, where the Yakshas, unable to face him, flee to their king, Kubera. Kubera permits them to fight, and a fierce battle ensues between the Yakshas and Rakshasas. Ravana, despite being attacked by various weapons, remains unharmed and retaliates fiercely. The Yakshas are overwhelmed and retreat, while Ravana's ministers cause great destruction. A powerful Yaksha named Sanyodhakantaka briefly challenges Ravana but is defeated. Ravana's might terrifies the Yakshas, causing them to flee in fear.
