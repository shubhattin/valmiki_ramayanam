## रावणनर्मदावगाहः (rAvaNanarmadAvagAhaH)
**Chapter Title** : Ravana's Bath in the Narmada

Rama, curious about Ravana's past, asks sage Agastya why the world was empty when Ravana roamed. Agastya explains that Ravana, the demon king, had conquered many kings and roamed the earth. Ravana reaches the city of Mahishmati, where King Arjuna is enjoying the Narmada River with his wives. Ravana, seeking battle, inquires about Arjuna's whereabouts. Ravana and his ministers bathe in the Narmada River, disturbing its waters. After bathing, Ravana performs rituals and worships a golden Shiva lingam. He sings and dances, expressing his devotion.
