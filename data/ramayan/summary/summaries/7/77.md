## स्वर्गिप्रश्नः (svargiprashnaH)
**Chapter Title** : Questioning the Celestial Being

In the Treta Yuga, a vast forest existed, devoid of humans and animals. I went there to perform penance. The forest was beautiful with diverse trees and a large lake filled with birds. I spent a night there and saw a divine chariot in the morning. A celestial being descended from the chariot and ate a corpse. After eating, he bathed in the lake and returned to the chariot. Curious, I asked him about his actions. He explained the reason behind his unusual behavior.
