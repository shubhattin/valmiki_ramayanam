**Chapter Title** : Sumali's Death

Ravana, the demon king, crosses Mount Kailash and reaches Indra's realm. The sound of his army approaching is like a stormy ocean. Indra, alarmed, urges the gods to prepare for battle against Ravana. The gods, led by Indra, arm themselves for the fight. Indra seeks help from Vishnu, who assures him that Ravana cannot be defeated by gods or demons due to a boon. Vishnu promises to be the cause of Ravana's death at the right time. A fierce battle ensues between the gods and demons. Sumali, a powerful demon, enters the battlefield and causes havoc. Savitra, one of the Vasus, confronts Sumali and kills him with a powerful mace. The demons, seeing Sumali's death, flee in fear.
