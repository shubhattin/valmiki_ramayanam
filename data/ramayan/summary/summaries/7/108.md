## विभीषणाद्यादेशः (vibhIShaNAdyAdEshaH)
**Chapter Title** : Vibhishana's Command

The messengers, urged by Rama, quickly traveled to Madhura. They informed Shatrughna about Lakshmana's departure and Rama's promise. They also mentioned the coronation of Rama's sons and the people's support. Rama established the city of Kushavati for Kusha and Shravasti for Lava. Rama and Bharata prepared to leave for heaven, leaving Ayodhya deserted. Shatrughna was informed and urged to hurry. Shatrughna gathered his people and priests, explaining the situation and his future with his brothers. He crowned his sons, Subahu and Shatrughati, as rulers of Madhura and Vaideha. Rama, with his followers, prepared for his heavenly journey. Sugriva and Vibhishana pledged their loyalty to Rama. Hanuman promised to keep Rama's stories alive on earth. Rama blessed his allies and prepared to leave with them.
