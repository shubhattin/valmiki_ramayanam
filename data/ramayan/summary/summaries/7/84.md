## वृत्रतपोवर्णनम् (vRtratapOvarNanam)
**Chapter Title** : Description of Vritra's Austerities

Lakshmana suggests to Rama the performance of the Ashvamedha sacrifice, a great purifying ritual. He recalls how Indra was purified of Brahmahatya by this sacrifice. In ancient times, a great Asura named Vritra was respected by all. Vritra was wise, just, and ruled the earth righteously. The earth was abundant and fertile under his rule. Vritra decided to perform intense austerities, leaving his son to rule. Indra, worried about Vritra's power, approached Vishnu for help. Vishnu was asked to assist in defeating Vritra to maintain cosmic balance.
