## सुमाल्यादिनिग्रहः (sumAlyAdinigrahaH)
**Chapter Title** : Subjugation of Sumali and Others

In this chapter, Padmanabha (Vishnu) attacks the demon army from behind. The demon leader, with red eyes and trembling crown, accuses Vishnu of cowardice for attacking from behind. He challenges Vishnu to a fair fight. Vishnu, holding his conch, discus, and mace, accepts the challenge. A fierce battle ensues, with Vishnu using his divine weapons. The demon leader is struck but stands firm like a mountain. Eventually, the demons, unable to withstand Vishnu's power, retreat to the netherworld. Sumali and his kin, defeated, decide to reside in the netherworld, away from Vishnu's wrath.
