## निमिवसिष्ठशापः (nimivasiShThashApaH)
**Chapter Title** : The Curse of Nimi and Vasishtha

King Nimi of the Ikshvaku dynasty was a virtuous and powerful ruler. He decided to perform a long sacrificial ritual to please his ancestors. He invited Sage Vasishtha to officiate, but Vasishtha was already committed to another ritual for Indra. Nimi then invited other sages to conduct the ritual. Vasishtha, upon returning, found the ritual already underway and cursed Nimi to lose his body. In retaliation, Nimi cursed Vasishtha to also lose his body. Both became bodiless but retained their spiritual powers.
