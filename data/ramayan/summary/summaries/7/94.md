## रामायणगानम् (rAmAyaNagAnam)
**Chapter Title** : The Song of Ramayana

Rama and his brothers perform morning rituals and listen to the Ramayana sung by Kusha and Lava. The song is beautifully composed and captivates everyone. Rama invites sages, scholars, and musicians to witness the performance. The audience is amazed by the resemblance of the singers to Rama. Kusha and Lava sing the first twenty chapters of the Ramayana. Rama offers them gold, but they humbly refuse, preferring their simple forest life. Rama inquires about the origin of the epic, and they reveal it was composed by Sage Valmiki. Rama expresses his desire to hear the entire epic.
