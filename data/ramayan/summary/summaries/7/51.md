## दुर्वासोवाक्यकथनम् (durvAsOvAkyakathanam)
**Chapter Title** : Durvasa's Prophecy

Laxman asks the charioteer to narrate Durvasa's prophecy. Durvasa, son of Atri, once stayed at Vasistha's ashram. King Dasharatha visited and asked about his lineage's future. Durvasa revealed a past curse on Vishnu, leading to Rama's human birth. Rama will rule Ayodhya for 11,000 years and perform many sacrifices. He will have two sons with Sita, but not in Ayodhya. The prophecy reassures Dasharatha about his lineage's prosperity.
