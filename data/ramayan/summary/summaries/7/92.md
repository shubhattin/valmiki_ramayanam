## हयचर्या (hayacharyA)
**Chapter Title** : Horse Ritual

Rama, the elder brother of Bharata, released a well-marked black horse for the Ashwamedha sacrifice. He appointed Lakshmana and priests to oversee the horse's journey. Rama, with his army, reached the sacred site of Naimisha. Kings from all over brought gifts, and Rama honored them. Bharata and Shatrughna provided food, drinks, and clothes to the guests. Sugriva and the Vanaras served the Brahmins. Vibhishana, with his Rakshasas, honored the sages. The grand Ashwamedha sacrifice was conducted smoothly, with Lakshmana guarding the horse. Everyone was satisfied, and no one left empty-handed.
