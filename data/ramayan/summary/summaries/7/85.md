## वृत्रवधः (vRtravadhaH)
**Chapter Title** : The Slaying of Vritra

Lakshmana listens to Rama's words and narrates the story of Vritra's defeat. Vishnu tells the gods he cannot kill Vritra due to a past friendship. He offers a plan to divide himself into three parts to help Indra defeat Vritra. The gods agree, and Indra uses Vishnu's power to kill Vritra. Indra is troubled by the sin of killing a Brahmin. The gods seek Vishnu's help to purify Indra. Vishnu advises a horse sacrifice to cleanse Indra of his sin.
