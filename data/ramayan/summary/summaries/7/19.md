## अनरण्यशापः (anaraNyashApaH)
**Chapter Title** : Anaranya's Curse

Ravana, the demon king, seeks battles with kings after defeating Marutta. He challenges them to fight or surrender. The wise kings, knowing Ravana's power, choose to surrender. Ravana reaches Ayodhya and challenges King Anaranya. Anaranya accepts the duel but is defeated by Ravana. Before dying, Anaranya curses Ravana that a descendant of his lineage, Rama, will kill him. Ravana laughs off the curse, but the gods acknowledge it with a shower of flowers.
