## हनूमदुत्पत्तिः (hanUmadutpattiH)
**Chapter Title** : Hanuman's Birth

Rama inquires about Hanuman's unmatched strength. The sage narrates Hanuman's heroic deeds, including leaping over the ocean to Lanka. Hanuman's bravery and intelligence are praised. As a child, Hanuman attempted to catch the sun, mistaking it for a fruit. Indra struck him with a thunderbolt, injuring his jaw. Vayu, Hanuman's father, withdrew air from the world in anger. The gods pleaded with Brahma to restore balance. Brahma blessed Hanuman with invincibility and wisdom.
