## इलस्त्रीत्वप्राप्तिः (ilastrItvaprAptiH)
**Chapter Title** : Ila's Transformation into a Woman

Rama listens to Lakshmana's words and responds with a smile. He recounts the story of King Ila, son of Kardama, who ruled the earth righteously. Ila went hunting in a beautiful forest and killed many animals. In the forest, Lord Shiva, in a playful mood, transformed everything, including Ila, into women. Distressed, Ila sought Shiva's help. Shiva, with Parvati's consent, granted Ila the ability to alternate between male and female forms each month. Ila was grateful and accepted the boon.
