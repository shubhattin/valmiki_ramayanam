## रामनिवर्तनम् (rAmanivartanam)
**Chapter Title** : Return of Rama

Rama, after hearing the sage's words, went to perform his evening prayers at a sacred lake. He then returned to the sage Agastya's hermitage. Agastya offered Rama pure food and herbs, which Rama enjoyed. The next morning, Rama sought permission from the sage to return to his city. Agastya praised Rama's purity and blessed him. Rama, after bidding farewell to the sages, boarded the Pushpaka Vimana. He was honored by the sages as he departed. Rama reached Ayodhya by midday and sent a message to Lakshmana and Bharata about his return.
