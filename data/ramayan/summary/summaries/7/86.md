## ब्रह्महत्यातरणम् (brahmahatyAtaraNam)
**Chapter Title** : Crossing the Sin of Brahmahatya

Indra, after killing the demon Vritra, was overwhelmed by the sin of Brahmahatya and lost consciousness. The world became disturbed and barren due to his absence. The gods, worried about the situation, decided to perform a horse sacrifice to cleanse Indra of his sin. The sacrifice was successful, and the sin of Brahmahatya was divided into four parts, each residing in different places. The gods were pleased, and Indra was purified and regained his strength. The world returned to normalcy, and the sacrifice was praised for its effectiveness. Lakshmana narrated this story to Rama, who was pleased and inspired to perform a similar sacrifice.
