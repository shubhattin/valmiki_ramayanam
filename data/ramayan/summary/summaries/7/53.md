## नृगशापकथनम् (nRgashApakathanam)
**Chapter Title** : The Curse of King Nriga

Rama praises Lakshmana for his wisdom and loyalty. He expresses concern about not addressing the people's needs for four days. Rama recalls the story of King Nriga, who gave away many cows to Brahmins. A cow strayed and was unknowingly given to another Brahmin, causing a dispute. The Brahmins cursed King Nriga to become a lizard until Vishnu's incarnation, Krishna, would free him. Rama emphasizes the importance of fulfilling duties to avoid such curses.
