## कुशलवजननम् (kushalavajananam)
**Chapter Title** : Birth of Kusha and Lava

On the same night Shatrughna stayed in the hermitage, Sita gave birth to twin sons. At midnight, the young hermit boys informed Valmiki about Sita's auspicious delivery. Valmiki, the great sage, came to see the divine-looking twins and performed protective rituals. He named the elder twin Kusha, using sacred grass, and the younger one Lava, using sacred rice. The twins were thus named Kusha and Lava, and they would become famous. Shatrughna heard the joyful news and expressed his happiness. The next morning, after performing his duties, Shatrughna left the hermitage and continued his journey.
