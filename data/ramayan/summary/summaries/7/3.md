## वैश्रवणलोकपालपदलङ्कादिप्राप्तिः (vaishravaNalOkapAlapadalankAdiprAptiH)
**Chapter Title** : Attainment of Lanka and the Position of Guardian of the World by Vaishravana

Sage Vishrava, son of Pulastya, was devoted to penance and righteousness. Bharadwaja gave his daughter in marriage to Vishrava, and they had a son named Vaishravana. Vaishravana performed intense penance for thousands of years. Pleased with his penance, Brahma granted him the position of the Guardian of Wealth. Brahma also gave him the Pushpaka Vimana and the city of Lanka to reside in. Vaishravana settled in Lanka, which was abandoned by the Rakshasas due to fear of Vishnu.
