## रावणनामप्राप्तिः (rAvaNanAmaprAptiH)
**Chapter Title** : Ravana's Naming

Ravana, the demon king, defeats his brother Kubera and travels to a sacred grove. He sees the Pushpaka Vimana, a divine chariot, unable to move. Nandi, Shiva's attendant, warns Ravana not to disturb the mountain where Shiva is playing. Ravana, angered, tries to lift the mountain. Shiva presses it down with his toe, trapping Ravana's arms. Ravana's cries shake the universe, and his ministers advise him to appease Shiva. Pleased with Ravana's strength and devotion, Shiva names him 'Ravana' and grants him a powerful sword and invincibility against gods and demons.
