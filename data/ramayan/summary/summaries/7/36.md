## हनूमद्वरप्राप्त्यादि (hanUmadvaraprAptyAdi)
**Chapter Title** : Hanuman's Boon Acquisition and More

Vayu, the wind god, was distressed over his son's death and approached Brahma. Brahma revived the child, Hanuman, granting him life. The gods, including Indra and Surya, bestowed boons on Hanuman, making him invincible and wise. Hanuman, unaware of his powers due to a sage's curse, caused mischief in hermitages. The sages cursed him to forget his strength until reminded. Hanuman's father, Kesari, ruled the vanaras before passing. Sugriva and Vali's enmity arose later. Hanuman's potential was recognized by the gods, and he was destined to aid Rama. Rama, impressed by Hanuman's story, invited sages to his sacrifices.
