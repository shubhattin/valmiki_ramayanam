## कौसल्यादिकालधर्मः (kausalyAdikAladharmaH)
**Chapter Title** : Kausalya's Final Rites

Rama gathers sages and listens to his sons sing the future Ramayana. Sita enters the earth, leaving Rama sorrowful. He completes the sacrifice and returns to Ayodhya with his sons. Rama never remarries, honoring Sita in every ritual. He performs many sacrifices, ensuring prosperity in his kingdom. Kausalya, Sumitra, and Kaikeyi pass away, joining Dasaratha in heaven. Rama gives generously to sages and performs rituals for his ancestors.
