## सौदासकथा (saudAsakathA)
**Chapter Title** : The Story of Saudasa

Shatrughna, after sending his army ahead, stayed for a month and then hurriedly traveled alone. He reached Valmiki's ashram and expressed his wish to stay for a night before continuing his journey. Valmiki welcomed him warmly, offering hospitality. Shatrughna inquired about a nearby sacrificial site, and Valmiki narrated the story of King Saudasa. Saudasa, in his youth, encountered two demons disguised as tigers and killed one. The surviving demon cursed Saudasa to become a cannibal. During a sacrifice, a demon disguised as a cook served human flesh to Vasistha, leading to a curse on Saudasa. Vasistha later mitigated the curse, allowing Saudasa to regain his kingdom after twelve years.
