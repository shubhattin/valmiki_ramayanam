## दण्डशापः (daNDashApaH)
**Chapter Title** : Curse of Danda

The sage returns to his hermitage with his disciples, feeling hungry. He sees the land covered in dust, like a lunar eclipse. Angered by King Danda's misdeeds, he predicts the king's downfall. The king and his kingdom will be destroyed in seven days due to a dust storm. All living beings in the area will perish. The sage instructs the people to leave the region. The sage's daughter is told to stay in the hermitage for safety. The prophecy comes true, and the kingdom is reduced to ashes. The area becomes known as Dandakaranya.
