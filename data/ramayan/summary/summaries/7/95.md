**Chapter Title** : Valmiki's Messenger Dispatch

Rama listened to the divine song sung by Kusha and Lava with sages and kings. He realized they were Sita's sons and spoke to his assembly. Rama sent pure messengers to Valmiki to convey his message. He asked if Sita could prove her purity in front of the assembly. The messengers conveyed Rama's words to Valmiki. Valmiki agreed, saying Sita would do as Rama wished. The messengers returned to Rama with Valmiki's response. Rama was pleased and informed the sages and kings about the upcoming event.
