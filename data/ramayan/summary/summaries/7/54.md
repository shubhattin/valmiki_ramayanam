## नृगश्वभ्रप्रवेशः (nRgashvabhrapravEshaH)
**Chapter Title** : Entry of King Nriga into the Pit

Lakshmana, understanding the essence, asks Rama about the curse on King Nriga. Rama explains how King Nriga was cursed by two angry Brahmins for a minor offense. King Nriga, realizing his sinful state, calls his ministers and people to inform them of his fate. He instructs them to make a comfortable pit for him to reside in until the curse is lifted. The pit is to be pleasant, with trees and flowers, and he plans to live there peacefully. King Nriga advises his son to rule justly and not to worry about his fate. He enters the pit adorned with jewels, accepting his destiny.
