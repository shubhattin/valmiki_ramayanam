## शत्रुघ्नप्रार्थना (shatrughnaprArthanA)
**Chapter Title** : Shatrughna's Request

Rama asks the sages about the demon Lavana's habits and whereabouts. The sages describe Lavana's violent nature and his dwelling in Madhuvana. Lavana consumes many creatures, including humans, as his daily food. Rama promises to eliminate the demon to relieve the sages' fear. Rama asks his brothers who will kill Lavana. Bharata volunteers, but Shatrughna requests the task, citing his past hardships. Rama agrees and decides to crown Shatrughna as king of Madhu's city after Lavana's defeat.
