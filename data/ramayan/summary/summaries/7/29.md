**Chapter Title** : Capture of Indra

In the darkness, gods and demons fought fiercely, unable to recognize each other. Ravana's army was mostly destroyed by the gods. Enraged, Ravana ordered his charioteer to drive him into the enemy ranks. He vowed to defeat the gods, including Indra. Indra decided to capture Ravana alive, knowing he couldn't kill him due to a boon. Ravana's son, Indrajit, used his magic to capture Indra. The gods were worried but couldn't see Indrajit. Ravana, pleased with his son's victory, returned home with Indra as a captive.
