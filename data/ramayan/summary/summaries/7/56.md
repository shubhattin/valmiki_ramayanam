## मैत्रावरुणित्वप्राप्तिः (maitrAvaruNitvaprAptiH)
**Chapter Title** : Attainment of the State of Mitra and Varuna

Lakshmana asks Rama how the sage and king regained their bodies. Rama explains they became wind spirits after cursing each other. Vasistha, as a spirit, visits Brahma for help. Brahma instructs him to enter the energy of Mitra and Varuna. Urvashi, an apsara, arrives at Varuna's abode. Varuna desires Urvashi, but she is promised to Mitra. Varuna releases his energy into a pot, leading to Urvashi's temporary exile to Earth. She marries King Pururavas and later returns to heaven.
