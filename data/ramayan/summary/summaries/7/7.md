## मालिवधः (mAlivadhaH)
**Chapter Title** : Destruction of Malyavan

The Rakshasas attacked Narayana Hill with a rain of arrows. Vishnu, surrounded by dark clouds, stood firm like a mountain. The Rakshasas' arrows were like insects against a mountain. Vishnu's arrows, swift as wind, pierced the Rakshasas. The sound of Vishnu's conch shell terrified the Rakshasas. Many Rakshasas fell to the ground, struck by Vishnu's arrows. Malyavan, a Rakshasa leader, was ultimately defeated by Vishnu's chakra.
