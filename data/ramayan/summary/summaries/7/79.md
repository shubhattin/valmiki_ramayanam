## दण्डराज्यनिवेशः (daNDarAjyanivEshaH)
**Chapter Title** : Establishment of Danda's Kingdom

Rama listens to Agastya's story with curiosity. Agastya narrates about King Shveta of Vidarbha. Shveta entered a deserted forest for penance. Manu, in the Krita Yuga, had a son named Ikshvaku. Manu instructed Ikshvaku to rule justly. Ikshvaku's son Danda was foolish and disobedient. Danda was given a kingdom in a desolate region. Danda established a city named Madhumanta.
