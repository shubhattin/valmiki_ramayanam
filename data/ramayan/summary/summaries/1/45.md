**Chapter Title** : The Emergence of Amrita

1. After hearing the words of Sage Vishwamitra, Rama and Lakshmana were filled with wonder and expressed their amazement at the sage's narration of the descent of the sacred Ganga and the filling of the ocean.
2. The night passed swiftly as Rama and Lakshmana contemplated the holy story told by Vishwamitra.
3. At dawn, Rama, having completed his morning rituals, requested Vishwamitra to cross the sacred river Ganga.
4. A boat, prepared by the sages, arrived promptly, and they crossed the river with the sage and other ascetics.
5. Upon reaching the northern bank, they honored the sages and beheld the grand city of Vishala.
6. Rama, curious about the city, inquired about its royal lineage from Vishwamitra.
7. Vishwamitra began narrating the ancient history of Vishala, starting with the story of the powerful sons of Diti and Aditi in the Krita Yuga.
8. The sons of Diti and Aditi, desiring immortality, decided to churn the ocean of milk to obtain the nectar of immortality, Amrita.
9. Using Mount Mandara as the churning rod and Vasuki as the churning rope, they began the churning process.
10. During the churning, a deadly poison, Halahala, emerged, threatening all beings.
11. The gods, in fear, sought refuge with Lord Shiva, who consumed the poison to save the universe.
12. The churning continued, and various divine beings and objects emerged, including the celestial horse Uchchaihshravas, the Kaustubha gem, and finally, the Amrita.
13. A fierce battle ensued between the gods and demons over the possession of Amrita.
14. Lord Vishnu, assuming the form of Mohini, a beautiful enchantress, tricked the demons and distributed the Amrita to the gods.
15. The gods, having consumed the Amrita, defeated the demons, and Indra regained his sovereignty over the heavens.
