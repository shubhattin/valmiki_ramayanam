## अमृतोत्पत्तिः (amRtOtpattiH)
**Chapter Title** : The Emergence of Amrita

Rama and Lakshmana listen to Viswamitra's story with amazement. They spend the night reflecting on the tale. In the morning, they cross the holy river Ganga. They reach the city of Vishala and Rama inquires about its history. Viswamitra begins to narrate the ancient story of Vishala. The Devas and Asuras churn the ocean to obtain Amrita. A deadly poison emerges, which Shiva consumes to save the world. The churning continues, producing various divine beings and treasures. Finally, Vishnu, in the form of Mohini, distributes Amrita to the Devas, leading to their victory over the Asuras.
