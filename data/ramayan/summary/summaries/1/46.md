## दितिगर्भभेदः (ditigarbhabhEdaH)
**Chapter Title** : Breaking of Diti's Womb

Diti was sad after her sons were killed. She asked her husband Kashyapa for a son to kill Indra. Kashyapa agreed if she stayed pure for a thousand years. Diti started her penance, and Indra served her. Near the end, Diti slept impurely. Indra entered her womb and split the fetus into seven. The fetus cried, and Indra calmed it. Diti forgave Indra for his actions.
