## दितिगर्भभेदः (ditigarbhabhEdaH)

**Chapter Title** : The Cleaving of Diti's Womb

1. Diti, deeply saddened by the death of her sons, approaches her husband, the sage Kashyapa, and expresses her desire to have a son who would be capable of slaying Indra.
2. Kashyapa, moved by her plea, agrees and instructs her to perform a rigorous penance for a thousand years, promising that if she remains pure, she will bear a son who will defeat Indra.
3. Diti begins her severe penance with great determination, and Indra, aware of her intentions, decides to serve her during this period.
4. Indra assists Diti by providing her with firewood, water, fruits, and roots, and also massages her limbs to relieve her fatigue.
5. As the thousand years of penance near completion, Diti, pleased with Indra's service, informs him that she will soon give birth to a son who will conquer the three worlds.
6. However, Diti falls asleep at noon, violating the condition of purity by placing her head at her feet.
7. Indra seizes this opportunity, enters her womb, and divides the fetus into seven parts using his thunderbolt.
8. The fetus cries out in pain, and Indra consoles it, telling it not to cry, and further divides each part into seven, resulting in the birth of the Maruts.
9. Diti awakens and realizes what has happened. Indra explains that he acted because she violated the condition of purity.
10. Indra requests Diti's forgiveness, and she, understanding the situation, forgives him, thus resulting in the birth of the Maruts, who become allies of Indra.
