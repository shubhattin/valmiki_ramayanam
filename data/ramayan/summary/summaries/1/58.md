**Chapter Title** : Trishanku's Curse

King Trishanku seeks to ascend to heaven in his mortal body. He approaches sage Vasishta, who refuses to help. Trishanku then turns to Vasishta's sons, who also deny him. Angered, they curse him to become a Chandala (outcast). Trishanku becomes a Chandala overnight. His ministers and followers abandon him. In despair, he seeks help from sage Vishwamitra. Vishwamitra, moved by Trishanku's plight, decides to help him. He promises to send Trishanku to heaven despite the curse.
