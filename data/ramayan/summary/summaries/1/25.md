## ताटकावृत्तान्तः (tATakAvRttAntaH)
**Chapter Title** : The Story of Tataka

Rama listens to sage Vishwamitra's words about the demoness Tataka. Vishwamitra explains Tataka's strength comes from a boon. Tataka was once a beautiful woman, given great strength by Brahma. She married Sunda and had a son, Maricha. After Sunda's death, Tataka attacked sage Agastya. Agastya cursed her to become a demoness. Vishwamitra urges Rama to kill Tataka to protect the land. Rama is told not to hesitate, as it's his duty to protect the people.
