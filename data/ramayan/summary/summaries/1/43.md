## गङ्गावतरणम् (gangAvataraNam)
**Chapter Title** : Descent of the Ganges

The gods and sages praise King Bhagiratha for his penance. Lord Shiva agrees to hold the Ganges in his hair. The Ganges descends from the heavens with great force. Shiva traps her in his hair to control her flow. After a year, he releases her, and she splits into seven streams. Three streams flow east, and three flow west. The seventh follows Bhagiratha's chariot. The Ganges purifies the ashes of Bhagiratha's ancestors, granting them salvation.
