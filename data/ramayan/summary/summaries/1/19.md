## विश्वामित्रवाक्यम् (vishvAmitravAkyam)

**Chapter Title** : The Words of Vishvamitra

1. Sage Vishvamitra, after hearing the words of the lion among kings, King Dasharatha, praises him for his noble lineage and the righteousness of his words.
2. Vishvamitra requests King Dasharatha to send his eldest son, Rama, to protect his sacrificial rites from the two powerful and well-trained demons, Maricha and Subahu, who disrupt the rituals by showering flesh and blood.
3. Vishvamitra assures the king that Rama, under his divine protection, is capable of defeating these demons and will gain great fame across the three worlds.
4. He emphasizes that no other warrior, except Rama, can defeat these demons, who are bound by the noose of time and filled with evil.
5. Vishvamitra promises that the demons will be slain and assures the king of Rama's safety, urging him not to let paternal affection hinder this decision.
6. The sage also mentions that the duration of the sacrifice is ten days, and Rama's presence is crucial for its successful completion.
7. Vishvamitra concludes by advising the king to consult with his ministers, including the wise Vasishta, and to grant permission for Rama to accompany him.
8. King Dasharatha, overwhelmed with sorrow and fear upon hearing Vishvamitra's request, is initially hesitant but is urged to make a decision for the greater good.
