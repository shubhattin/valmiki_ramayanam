## ब्रह्मदत्तविवाहः (brahmadattavivAhaH)
**Chapter Title** : Brahmadatta's Marriage

King Kushanabha's daughters were approached by the wind god, Vayu, who wanted to marry them. The daughters refused, saying they would only marry with their father's consent. Vayu cursed them, making them hunchbacked. King Kushanabha praised his daughters for their patience and decided to marry them to a suitable groom. Sage Chuli, pleased with a Gandharva woman named Somada, granted her a son, Brahmadatta. King Kushanabha chose Brahmadatta as the groom for his daughters. Upon marriage, the daughters were freed from Vayu's curse and regained their beauty.
