**Chapter Title** : Indra and Ahalya's Curse

King Sumati inquires about the two young princes, Rama and Lakshmana, who are visiting with sage Vishwamitra. Vishwamitra explains their journey and the defeat of demons. The king honors the princes. They continue to Mithila, where they see an ancient, deserted hermitage. Vishwamitra tells the story of sage Gautama's hermitage, where Indra, disguised as Gautama, deceived Ahalya. Gautama cursed Indra and Ahalya. Ahalya was to remain invisible until Rama's arrival, which would purify her. Gautama left to meditate in the Himalayas.
