**Chapter Title** : Indra and Ahalya's Curse

1. The chapter begins with a conversation between Sumati and the great sage Vishwamitra, where Sumati inquires about the two divine-like princes, Rama and Lakshmana, who have arrived in the region.
2. Sumati is curious about their purpose and the reason for their journey on such a difficult path, carrying mighty weapons.
3. Vishwamitra narrates the events leading to their arrival, including their stay at Siddhashrama and the slaying of demons.
4. The king, upon hearing Vishwamitra's words, is astonished and honors the two sons of Dasharatha, Rama and Lakshmana, with due respect and hospitality.
5. After receiving hospitality, Rama and Lakshmana continue their journey to Mithila, where they are warmly welcomed by the sages.
6. As they approach Mithila, Rama notices an ancient, deserted hermitage and inquires about its history from Vishwamitra.
7. Vishwamitra explains that the hermitage once belonged to the great sage Gautama and was revered even by the gods.
8. Gautama lived there with his wife Ahalya, performing penance for many years.
9. Indra, the king of gods, disguised himself as Gautama and approached Ahalya with the desire for union.
10. Ahalya, recognizing Indra in disguise, succumbed to his advances out of curiosity and desire.
11. After the union, Indra hurriedly left the hermitage, fearing Gautama's return.
12. Gautama, upon returning and realizing the deceit, cursed Indra to lose his manhood and cursed Ahalya to remain invisible, subsisting on air, and covered in ashes for thousands of years.
13. Ahalya was told she would be redeemed and regain her form when Rama, the son of Dasharatha, visits the hermitage.
14. Gautama then left the hermitage to continue his penance in the Himalayas, leaving Ahalya to her fate.
