**Chapter Title** : The Encounter with Parashurama

1. After the night passed, the great sage Vishwamitra, having taken leave of the two kings, proceeded to the northern mountains.
2. With Vishwamitra gone, King Dasharatha, after bidding farewell to King Janaka of Videha, quickly returned to his city.
3. King Janaka of Videha gave a large dowry, including hundreds of thousands of cows, to the newlywed couple.
4. He also gifted fine woolen and silk garments, elephants, horses, chariots, and foot soldiers, all beautifully adorned.
5. King Janaka, in high spirits, gave away a hundred maidens along with excellent male and female servants, gold, silver, pearls, and coral.
6. After giving these various gifts, King Janaka, having taken leave of the other kings, returned to his city of Mithila.
7. King Dasharatha, along with his noble sons, led by the sages, set out on their journey back to Ayodhya.
8. As they traveled, ominous birds began to cry out, and all the terrestrial animals started moving in a clockwise direction.
9. Observing these signs, King Dasharatha inquired of Sage Vashistha about the inauspicious omens.
10. Sage Vashistha, with a sweet voice, explained that a great danger was approaching, as indicated by the celestial birds.
11. As they conversed, a strong wind arose, shaking the earth and toppling great trees.
12. The sun was obscured by darkness, and the entire army seemed bewildered, covered in ash.
13. Amidst this darkness, the sages and King Dasharatha, along with his sons, remained conscious, while others were confused.
14. In this terrifying darkness, the army appeared as if covered in ash, and they beheld the formidable figure of Parashurama, the son of Jamadagni.
15. Parashurama, resembling the mighty Kailasa mountain and the fierce fire of destruction, was seen holding a battle-axe on his shoulder and a bow resembling a streak of lightning.
16. The sages, led by Vashistha, engaged in chants and offerings, gathered and conversed among themselves.
17. They wondered if Parashurama, who had previously annihilated the Kshatriya race, was once again intent on their destruction.
18. Having performed the ritual of offering water, the sages addressed Parashurama with sweet words, calling him by name.
19. Parashurama, accepting the honor given by the sages, spoke to Rama, the son of Dasharatha.
