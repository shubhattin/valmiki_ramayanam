## भगीरथवरप्रदानम् (bhagIrathavarapradAnam)
**Chapter Title** : Bhagiratha's Boon

King Sagara's people chose Anshuman as their new king after Sagara's death. Anshuman's son, Dilipa, became a great king. Dilipa performed severe penance in the Himalayas for 32,000 years and attained heaven. His son, Bhagiratha, was born while Dilipa was contemplating how to bring the Ganges to earth. Bhagiratha became king and performed intense penance to bring the Ganges down. Lord Brahma, pleased with Bhagiratha's penance, granted his wish. Bhagiratha was advised to seek Lord Shiva's help to bear the Ganges' descent.
