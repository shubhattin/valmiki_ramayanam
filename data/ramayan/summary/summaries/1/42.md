## भगीरथवरप्रदानम् (bhagIrathavarapradAnam)

**Chapter Title** : Bhagiratha's Boon Granting

1. After King Sagara's demise, the ministers and people of the kingdom chose Anshuman, a virtuous prince, as their king.
2. Anshuman became a great king and had a son named Dilipa, who was renowned for his virtues.
3. Anshuman, after entrusting the kingdom to Dilipa, performed severe penance in the Himalayas for 32,000 years and attained heaven.
4. King Dilipa, upon learning about his ancestors' demise, was troubled and could not find a way to bring the Ganga to earth for their salvation.
5. Dilipa's constant contemplation on this matter led to the birth of his son, Bhagiratha, who was exceedingly righteous.
6. Dilipa performed many sacrifices and ruled the kingdom for 30,000 years but could not fulfill the task of bringing the Ganga.
7. Eventually, Dilipa succumbed to illness and passed away, ascending to Indra's realm due to his virtuous deeds.
8. Bhagiratha, a righteous king, was childless and desired progeny. He entrusted the kingdom to his ministers and focused on bringing the Ganga to earth.
9. Bhagiratha performed severe penance at Gokarna, standing with arms raised, subsisting on air, and controlling his senses for thousands of years.
10. Pleased with Bhagiratha's penance, Lord Brahma, along with other deities, appeared before him and offered him a boon.
11. Bhagiratha requested that the ashes of his ancestors be sanctified by the waters of the Ganga, allowing them to attain heaven.
12. He also wished for the continuity of his lineage and the prosperity of the Ikshvaku dynasty.
13. Lord Brahma granted Bhagiratha's wish, instructing him to seek Lord Shiva's help to bear the descent of the Ganga, as the earth could not withstand her fall.
14. After advising Bhagiratha, Lord Brahma returned to the heavens with the other deities.
