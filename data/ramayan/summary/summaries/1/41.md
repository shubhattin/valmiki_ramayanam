## सगरयज्ञसमाप्तिः (sagarayajnasamAptiH)
**Chapter Title** : Completion of Sagara's Sacrifice

King Sagara learns about his sons' disappearance and instructs his grandson Anshuman to find them and the stolen horse. Anshuman, armed with a sword and bow, ventures underground as guided by his father. He encounters divine beings and is directed by the guardian elephants of the directions. Anshuman finds his uncles turned to ashes and the sacrificial horse nearby. Grieving, he seeks water for their last rites but is advised by Garuda to use the Ganges for their salvation. Anshuman returns with the horse, and King Sagara completes the sacrifice. However, Sagara is unable to bring the Ganges to earth and rules for 30,000 years before passing away.
