## कामाश्रमवासः (kAmAshramavAsaH)
**Chapter Title** : Residence at Kamashrama

Rama and Lakshmana are awakened by sage Vishwamitra at dawn. They perform their morning rituals and prepare to continue their journey. They reach the confluence of the Sarayu River and a sacred place of sages. Curious about the place, they ask Vishwamitra about its significance. Vishwamitra explains it was once the abode of Kamadeva, who was turned into a bodiless entity by Lord Shiva. The sages welcome Rama and Lakshmana, offering them hospitality. They spend the night there, enjoying stories and the company of the sages.
