Rama, with a joyful face, requests the knowledge to withdraw divine weapons from sage Vishwamitra. Vishwamitra, pleased with Rama's request, grants him the knowledge of weapon withdrawal. Various divine weapons appear before Rama, offering their service. Rama accepts their service and instructs them to assist him when needed. The weapons, in various forms, promise to help Rama and depart. Rama expresses curiosity about a nearby forest and asks Vishwamitra about it.
