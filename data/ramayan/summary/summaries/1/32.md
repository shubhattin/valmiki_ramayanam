**Chapter Title** : The Story of Kushanabha's Daughters

1. The great sage Kusha, known for his immense penance and adherence to dharma, had four sons with his wife from the Vidarbha region.
2. These sons, named Kushamba, Kushanabha, Asurtarajas, and Vasu, were endowed with great strength and enthusiasm to uphold the Kshatriya dharma.
3. Kusha instructed his sons to establish their own kingdoms and rule righteously.
4. Following their father's advice, the sons established their own cities: Kushamba founded Kaushambi, Kushanabha established Mahodaya, Asurtarajas created Dharmaranya, and Vasu founded Girivraja.
5. The land of Vasu, known for its fertile fields and the beautiful Sumagadhi river, was particularly prosperous.
6. Kushanabha, a righteous king, had a hundred beautiful daughters with the celestial nymph Ghritachi.
7. These daughters, adorned with exquisite ornaments, were once enjoying themselves in a garden, singing and dancing.
8. The wind god, Vayu, enamored by their beauty, proposed to them, offering them immortality and eternal youth if they became his wives.
9. The daughters, adhering to their dharma, respectfully declined Vayu's offer, stating their loyalty to their father and their commitment to marry whom he chooses for them.
10. Angered by their refusal, Vayu cursed them, causing their bodies to become deformed.
11. The daughters, now disfigured, returned to their father's palace, filled with shame and tears.
12. King Kushanabha, upon seeing his beloved daughters in such a state, was deeply distressed and sought to understand the cause of their plight.
