**Chapter Title** : The Story of Kushanabha's Daughters

Kusha, a great sage, had four sons with his wife from the Vidarbha region. He instructed them to rule righteously. Each son founded a city, with Kushanabha establishing Mahodaya. Kushanabha had a hundred beautiful daughters. The wind god, Vayu, desired them as his wives, promising eternal youth. The daughters refused, valuing their father's wishes. Angered, Vayu deformed them. They returned home, ashamed and in tears. Their father, the king, was shocked and sought to understand the cause of their plight.
