## ब्रह्मर्षित्वप्राप्तिः (brahmarShitvaprAptiH)
**Chapter Title** : Attainment of Brahmarshi Status

Sage Vishwamitra leaves the northern direction and moves east to perform severe penance. He maintains silence for a thousand years, showing immense dedication. Despite many disturbances, he remains calm and focused. After completing his penance, he prepares to eat, but Indra, disguised as a Brahmin, asks for his food. Vishwamitra gives all his food to Indra without eating himself. His intense penance causes smoke to rise from his head, alarming the three worlds. The gods, led by Brahma, approach Vishwamitra and grant him the status of Brahmarshi. Vishwamitra is pleased and acknowledges Vashistha as a friend. King Janaka praises Vishwamitra for his achievements and invites him to visit again. Vishwamitra, along with Rama and Lakshmana, returns to his abode, honored by all.
