**Chapter Title** : Vasishtha's Curse

King Vishwamitra, transformed into a Chandala, is welcomed by Sage Vasishtha. Vasishtha promises to help him perform a sacrifice. He calls upon other sages to assist. However, the sages refuse to participate due to Vishwamitra's Chandala form. Angered, Vishwamitra curses them to be reborn as cruel beings. He also curses Mahodaya, a sage who insulted him, to become a Nishada. Vishwamitra's anger leads to the downfall of these sages.
