**Chapter Title** : The Origin of Bears and Monkeys

Brahma instructed the gods to create powerful allies for Vishnu. These allies were to be strong, wise, and capable of changing forms. The gods created beings from various celestial and earthly sources. Indra created Vali, and the Sun created Sugriva. Other gods created more powerful monkeys and bears. Hanuman, son of the Wind God, was among them. These beings were destined to help Rama in his quest. They were strong, brave, and skilled in warfare.
