## शबलानिष्क्रयः (shabalAniShkrayaH)
**Chapter Title** : Shabalaniṣkrayaḥ

Sage Vasistha had a divine cow named Shabala. Shabala could fulfill any desire. King Vishwamitra visited Vasistha and was impressed by Shabala's powers. Vishwamitra offered a hundred thousand cows in exchange for Shabala. Vasistha refused, saying Shabala was invaluable. Vishwamitra then offered gold, elephants, and horses, but Vasistha still refused. Vasistha explained that Shabala was essential for his rituals and life.
