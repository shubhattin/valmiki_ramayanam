**Chapter Title** : Summary of the Story of Uma and Ganga

The sages spent the night on the banks of the river Shona. At dawn, Vishwamitra woke Rama and suggested they prepare to leave. Rama asked how they would cross the deep river Shona. Vishwamitra showed them the path used by great sages. They traveled through various forests and reached the sacred river Ganga by midday. The sages and Rama were delighted to see the holy river. They settled on its banks, performed rituals, and offered prayers. Rama expressed his desire to learn about the origin of the river Ganga. Vishwamitra narrated the story of Ganga and Uma, daughters of the mountain king Himavan.
