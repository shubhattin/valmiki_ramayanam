Sage Vishwamitra narrates the story of King Sagara to Rama. King Sagara, a virtuous ruler of Ayodhya, had two wives, Kesini and Sumati. The king performed penance to have children, and Sage Bhrigu granted him a boon. Kesini would have one son, and Sumati would have sixty thousand sons. Kesini's son was named Asamanja, while Sumati's sons were born from a gourd. Asamanja was wicked and exiled by Sagara. Asamanja's son, Anshuman, was virtuous and beloved by all.
