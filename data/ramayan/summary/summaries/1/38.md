**Chapter Title** : The Birth of Sagara's Sons

1. Sage Vishvamitra narrates the story of King Sagara to Lord Rama.
2. King Sagara, a virtuous and childless ruler of Ayodhya, had two wives: Kesini and Sumati.
3. Kesini was the daughter of the king of Vidarbha, and Sumati was the sister of Garuda and daughter of Arishtanemi.
4. The king, along with his wives, performed penance on the mountain Bhriguprasravana in the Himalayas to beget children.
5. After a hundred years of penance, Sage Bhrigu, pleased with their devotion, granted them a boon.
6. The boon promised a great progeny: one wife would bear a son who would continue the dynasty, and the other would bear sixty thousand sons.
7. The queens, pleased with the boon, asked the sage to specify which wife would bear which children.
8. Sage Bhrigu allowed them to choose, and Kesini chose to have the dynasty-continuing son, while Sumati chose to have sixty thousand sons.
9. The king and his wives returned to Ayodhya, and in due course, Kesini gave birth to Asamanja, and Sumati gave birth to a gourd-like womb from which sixty thousand sons emerged.
10. The sons were nurtured in ghee-filled pots and grew into strong and youthful princes.
11. Asamanja, the eldest son, was mischievous and often troubled the citizens, leading to his exile by King Sagara.
12. Asamanja's son, Anshuman, was virtuous and beloved by all.
13. King Sagara decided to perform a great sacrifice, and with the guidance of learned priests, he prepared for the ritual.
