**Chapter Title** : The Sale of Shunahshepa

1. Sage Vishwamitra, observing the sages preparing to leave, suggested relocating to the western region of Pushkara for uninterrupted penance.
2. Meanwhile, King Ambarisha of Ayodhya commenced a sacrificial ritual, but the sacrificial animal was taken by Indra.
3. The priest advised the king to find a substitute for the sacrificial animal to avoid the ritual's failure.
4. King Ambarisha, in search of a substitute, approached Sage Richika, offering a thousand cows for one of his sons.

6. Shunahshepa, the middle son, volunteered himself for the sacrifice.
7. King Ambarisha, pleased, took Shunahshepa with him, offering wealth and cattle in exchange.
