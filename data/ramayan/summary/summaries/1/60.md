## त्रिशंकुस्वर्गः (trishankusvargaH)
**Chapter Title** : Trishanku's Heaven

Sage Vishwamitra decides to help King Trishanku reach heaven in his mortal body. Trishanku seeks refuge with Vishwamitra after being cursed by Sage Vashistha's sons. Vishwamitra starts a grand sacrifice to send Trishanku to heaven. The gods refuse to accept Trishanku in heaven. Vishwamitra, in anger, creates a new heaven and stars for Trishanku. The gods, fearing Vishwamitra's power, agree to let Trishanku stay in the new heaven. Trishanku remains upside down in the sky, and Vishwamitra's creation is acknowledged.
