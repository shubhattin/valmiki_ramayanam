## मिथिलाप्रस्थानम् (mithilAprasthAnam)
**Chapter Title** : Departure to Mithila

Rama and Lakshmana spent the night happily after achieving their goals. In the morning, they performed their morning rituals and approached Sage Vishwamitra. They respectfully asked for his instructions. Vishwamitra and other sages planned to attend King Janaka's grand sacrifice in Mithila. Vishwamitra invited Rama to witness the divine bow there. The bow was a gift from the gods, and no one could lift it. Many kings had tried but failed. Vishwamitra and the sages began their journey to Mithila. They were accompanied by animals and birds from the hermitage. They traveled a long distance and rested by the Shona river. Rama, curious about the place, asked Vishwamitra about it.
