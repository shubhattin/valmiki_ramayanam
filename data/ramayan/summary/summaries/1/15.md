**Chapter Title** : The Strategy to Kill Ravana

The wise sage, after contemplation, spoke to the king about performing a ritual for having sons. The ritual was conducted with sacred chants, and the gods gathered to receive their offerings. The gods expressed their concern to Brahma about the demon Ravana, who was causing trouble. Brahma revealed that Ravana could only be killed by a human, as he had a boon making him invulnerable to gods. Vishnu was requested to incarnate as a human to defeat Ravana. Vishnu agreed and planned to be born as the son of King Dasharatha. The gods and sages praised Vishnu for his decision to protect the world.
