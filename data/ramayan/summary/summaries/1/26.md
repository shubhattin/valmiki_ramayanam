## ताटकावधः (tATakAvadhaH)

**Chapter Title** : The Slaying of Tataka

1. Raghava (Rama), after hearing the firm words of the sage, with folded hands, expressed his readiness to fulfill the command of his father and the sage Vishwamitra without hesitation.
2. Rama, recalling the instructions given by his father, King Dasharatha, in the presence of his teachers in Ayodhya, resolved to carry out the task of slaying Tataka.
3. He acknowledged the importance of protecting cows and Brahmins, and the welfare of the country, and thus prepared to execute the sage's command.
4. Rama, the subduer of enemies, strung his bow and made a loud twang, which echoed through the directions, causing fear among the inhabitants of Tataka's forest.
5. Tataka, enraged and bewildered by the sound, rushed towards the source of the noise.
6. Observing the terrifying and monstrous form of Tataka, Rama spoke to Lakshmana about her dreadful appearance.
7. Rama expressed his reluctance to kill a woman, but acknowledged the necessity due to her evil nature and the threat she posed.
8. As Tataka charged towards Rama, the sage Vishwamitra encouraged him to slay her, emphasizing her wickedness and the need to prevent her from disrupting sacrifices.
9. Rama, demonstrating his skill in archery, intercepted Tataka's attacks and eventually pierced her chest with an arrow, leading to her death.
10. The gods, witnessing the fall of the fearsome Tataka, praised Rama for his valor and urged Vishwamitra to bestow his blessings upon him.
11. Vishwamitra, pleased with Rama's deed, invited him to stay the night in the forest, promising to proceed to his hermitage the next day.
12. The forest, freed from Tataka's curse, regained its beauty, resembling the celestial garden of Chaitraratha.
13. Rama, lauded by the gods and sages, spent the night in the forest, ready to continue his journey with the sage at dawn.
