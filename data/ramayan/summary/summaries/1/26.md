## ताटकावधः (tATakAvadhaH)
**Chapter Title** : The Slaying of Tataka

Rama, following his father's and sage Vishwamitra's instructions, prepares to kill the demoness Tataka. He is determined to fulfill his duty without hesitation. Rama and Lakshmana encounter the fierce Tataka, who attacks them with her magical powers. Rama initially hesitates to kill her because she is a woman, but Vishwamitra urges him to act. Rama uses his arrows to cut off her arms and eventually kills her. The gods praise Rama for his bravery. Vishwamitra is pleased and blesses Rama, and they spend the night in the now peaceful forest.
