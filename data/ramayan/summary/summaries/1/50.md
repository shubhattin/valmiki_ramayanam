**Chapter Title** : Meeting with Janaka

Rama and Lakshmana, guided by Sage Vishwamitra, arrive at King Janaka's sacrificial site. They observe the grand arrangements and numerous learned Brahmins present. Vishwamitra finds a suitable place for them to stay. King Janaka, informed of Vishwamitra's arrival, welcomes him with respect. Janaka inquires about the well-being of his kingdom and the success of the sacrifice. He expresses gratitude for Vishwamitra's presence, considering it a blessing. Janaka is curious about the identity of Rama and Lakshmana, who appear divine. Vishwamitra introduces them as the sons of King Dasharatha and narrates their journey and deeds.
