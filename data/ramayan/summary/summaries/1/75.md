## वैष्णवधनुःप्रशंसा (vaiShNavadhanuHprashaMsA)
**Chapter Title** : Praise of the Vaishnava Bow

1. The chapter begins with the sage Parashurama addressing Rama, the son of Dasharatha, acknowledging his extraordinary valor and the feat of breaking the bow.
2. Parashurama presents another formidable bow, the Jamadagnya bow, to Rama and challenges him to string it, thereby demonstrating his strength.
3. King Dasharatha, distressed and anxious, pleads with Parashurama to spare his young sons, emphasizing Parashurama's status as a revered Brahmin and his own sons' youth.
4. Parashurama, disregarding Dasharatha's plea, continues to address Rama, presenting two divine and powerful bows crafted by Vishwakarma, revered by the worlds.
5. One bow was given to Lord Shiva for the destruction of Tripura, which Rama had already broken, and the other, the Vaishnava bow, was given to Vishnu.
6. Parashurama narrates the history of these bows, including a great conflict between Shiva and Vishnu, where the gods and sages witnessed Vishnu's superior prowess.
7. The Vaishnava bow was eventually handed down to Parashurama's ancestors and now to him, as a symbol of his lineage and duty.
8. Parashurama challenges Rama to string the Vaishnava bow and promises a duel if he succeeds, thus testing Rama's adherence to Kshatriya dharma and his martial prowess.
