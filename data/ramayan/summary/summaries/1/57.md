## त्रिशंकुयाजनप्रार्थना (trishankuyAjanaprArthanA)
**Chapter Title** : Trishanku's Request for Sacrifice

Sage Vishwamitra, feeling humiliated, went south with his wife to perform intense penance. He lived on fruits and roots, and his sons were born, devoted to truth and righteousness. After a thousand years, Brahma acknowledged Vishwamitra's penance, granting him the status of a royal sage. However, Vishwamitra was dissatisfied, feeling his penance bore no fruit. Meanwhile, King Trishanku desired to ascend to heaven in his physical form. He approached Sage Vasistha, who refused his request. Trishanku then sought help from Vasistha's sons, who also declined. Trishanku, determined, continued his quest for a solution.
