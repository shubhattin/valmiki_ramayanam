## त्रिशंकुयाजनप्रार्थना (trishankuyAjanaprArthanA)

**Chapter Title** : Trishanku's Request for Sacrifice

1. Sage Vishwamitra, after being humiliated by King Harishchandra, went to the southern direction with his wife and performed severe penance, subsisting on fruits and roots.
2. Over time, Vishwamitra's sons were born, who were devoted to truth and righteousness.
3. After a thousand years of penance, Brahma, the creator, appeared and acknowledged Vishwamitra's penance, granting him the status of a Rajarshi (royal sage).
4. Despite this recognition, Vishwamitra was dissatisfied, feeling that his penance had not borne the desired fruit, and resolved to perform even more severe penance.
5. During this time, King Trishanku of the Ikshvaku dynasty desired to perform a great sacrifice and ascend to heaven in his physical body.
6. Trishanku approached Sage Vasistha with his wish, but Vasistha refused, stating it was impossible.
7. Undeterred, Trishanku sought the help of Vasistha's sons, who were also engaged in penance, but they too refused his request.
8. Trishanku, feeling rejected, humbly pleaded with Vasistha's sons to allow him to perform the sacrifice, expressing his desire to reach the divine realms with his physical body.
9. He acknowledged Vasistha's refusal and sought the assistance of the sage's sons, considering them his last hope to fulfill his wish.
