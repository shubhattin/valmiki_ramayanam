## ब्रह्मागमनम् (brahmAgamanam)
**Chapter Title** : The Arrival of Brahma

1. After hearing the words of Narada, the virtuous and wise Valmiki, along with his disciples, honored the great sage.
2. Narada, having been duly worshipped, took leave and ascended to the heavens.
3. Valmiki, after Narada's departure, went to the banks of the Tamasa river, near the Ganges.
4. Observing the clear and serene waters, Valmiki instructed his disciple Bharadwaja to prepare for a bath.
5. As Valmiki wandered, he witnessed a pair of Krauncha birds, and a hunter killed the male bird.
6. The female bird, seeing her partner slain, cried out in sorrow, which moved Valmiki deeply.
7. In his grief, Valmiki uttered a curse upon the hunter, which spontaneously formed a shloka (verse).
8. Reflecting on the incident, Valmiki realized the verse was born out of his sorrow.
9. Brahma, the creator, appeared before Valmiki and encouraged him to compose the Ramayana in the same poetic meter.
10. Brahma assured Valmiki that he would know all events of Rama's life, both public and private.
11. Valmiki was inspired to compose the Ramayana, a sacred and delightful narrative, in the form of shlokas.
12. The Ramayana would endure as long as the mountains and rivers exist on earth.
13. Brahma blessed Valmiki, promising him eternal fame and residence in the celestial realms.
14. Valmiki, filled with wonder, began the composition of the Ramayana, which would bring glory to Rama's deeds.
