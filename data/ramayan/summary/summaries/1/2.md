## ब्रह्मागमनम् (brahmAgamanam)
**Chapter Title** : Arrival of Brahma

Valmiki, after hearing Narada's words, honored the sage with his disciples. Narada, pleased, left for the heavens. Valmiki went to the Tamasa river with his disciple Bharadwaja. There, he saw a hunter kill a male bird, causing its mate to cry in sorrow. Moved by compassion, Valmiki cursed the hunter, which spontaneously formed a shloka. Brahma appeared and encouraged Valmiki to write the Ramayana in this poetic form. Valmiki, inspired, decided to compose the epic.
