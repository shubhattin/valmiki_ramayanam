**Chapter Title** : Rishyasringa's Story

King Romapada faced a severe drought in his kingdom. The wise Brahmins advised him to bring Rishyasringa, a sage's son, to end the drought. Rishyasringa lived in the forest, unaware of the outside world. The king sent courtesans to lure Rishyasringa to the kingdom. Rishyasringa's presence brought rain, ending the drought. King Romapada gave his daughter Shanta in marriage to Rishyasringa. This fulfilled the prophecy of Rishyasringa's role in ending the drought.
