## कुमारोत्पत्तिः (kumArOtpattiH)
**Chapter Title** : Birth of the Prince

The gods, led by Indra and Agni, approached Brahma seeking a commander for their army. Brahma assured them that a son would be born to the daughter of the mountain, who would become their commander. The divine Ganga was chosen to bear the child, and Agni was tasked to place the seed in her. Ganga, unable to contain the energy, released it on the Himalayas, creating gold and other metals. The child, born from this energy, was nurtured by the Krittikas and named Kartikeya. Kartikeya, with six faces, drank milk from the Krittikas and grew powerful, defeating demon armies. He was appointed as the commander of the divine forces.
