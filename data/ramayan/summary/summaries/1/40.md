## कपिलदर्शनम् (kapiladarshanam)
**Chapter Title** : Kapila's Revelation

The gods, worried about the power of Kapila, approach Brahma for guidance. Brahma reassures them that Kapila, an incarnation of Vishnu, is protecting the earth. Sagara's sons dig the earth to find the sacrificial horse. They encounter divine elephants guarding the directions. They finally find Kapila with the horse. Mistaking him for a thief, they attack. Kapila, in anger, turns them to ashes with his gaze.
