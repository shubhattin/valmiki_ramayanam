**Chapter Title** : The Vision of Kapila

3. Brahma foretells that the sons of King Sagara will be burnt by the fire of Kapila's anger.
4. The gods, relieved by Brahma's words, return to their abodes.
5. The sons of Sagara, while digging the earth, create a thunderous sound.
6. They report to their father, King Sagara, that they have circled the earth but have not found the sacrificial horse or its thief.
7. King Sagara instructs his sons to continue digging until they find the horse thief.
8. The sixty thousand sons of Sagara continue their search, digging through the earth.
9. They encounter the guardian elephants of the directions, who support the earth, and pay their respects.
10. The sons of Sagara dig through the southern, western, and northern directions, encountering more guardian elephants.
11. In the northeastern direction, they find the sage Kapila and the sacrificial horse nearby.
12. Mistaking Kapila for the horse thief, they angrily confront him.
13. Kapila, in his divine anger, utters a hum sound, reducing all the sons of Sagara to ashes.
