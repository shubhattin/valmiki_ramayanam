## मेनकानिर्वासः (mEnakAnirvAsaH)
**Chapter Title** : Exile of Menaka

The gods approached the sage Vishwamitra after he completed a thousand years of penance. Brahma praised him for his achievements and declared him a great sage. Vishwamitra continued his penance, and Menaka, a celestial nymph, came to bathe in the Pushkara lakes. Vishwamitra, captivated by her beauty, invited her to stay in his hermitage. They lived together for ten years, which distracted Vishwamitra from his penance. Realizing the distraction, Vishwamitra sent Menaka away and resumed his penance with renewed determination. The gods, fearing his growing power, planned to disrupt his penance again.
