## मेनकानिर्वासः (mEnakAnirvAsaH)

**Chapter Title** : Exile of Menaka

1. After completing a thousand years of penance, the great sage Vishwamitra was approached by all the gods, who wished to bestow the fruits of his austerities.
2. Brahma, the lord of the gods, addressed Vishwamitra, acknowledging his status as a sage due to his virtuous deeds.
3. After speaking to Vishwamitra, Brahma returned to the heavens, and Vishwamitra continued his intense penance.
4. In due course, Menaka, the foremost of Apsaras, came to bathe in the Pushkara lakes.
5. Vishwamitra, captivated by Menaka's unparalleled beauty, invited her to stay in his hermitage.
6. Overcome by desire, Vishwamitra requested Menaka to bless him with her presence, and she agreed to stay.
7. The presence of Menaka became a great obstacle to Vishwamitra's penance, and they spent ten years together in bliss.
8. Eventually, Vishwamitra realized the distraction and was filled with remorse and anger towards the gods for their interference.
9. Recognizing the divine plot to disrupt his penance, Vishwamitra decided to renounce Menaka and continue his austerities.
10. He released Menaka with kind words and proceeded to the northern mountains to resume his penance with renewed determination.
11. Vishwamitra undertook severe penance on the banks of the Kaushiki River, enduring harsh conditions for a thousand years.
12. The intensity of his penance caused concern among the gods, who convened to address the situation.
13. The gods, along with the sages, decided to bestow the title of 'Maharshi' upon Vishwamitra.
14. Brahma, pleased with Vishwamitra's penance, granted him the status of a great sage, but Vishwamitra aspired for the title of 'Brahmarshi.'
15. Brahma advised Vishwamitra to continue his penance to achieve complete control over his senses.
16. Vishwamitra, determined to achieve his goal, continued his penance with even greater intensity, enduring extreme conditions.
17. The gods, including Indra, became anxious about Vishwamitra's growing power and sought to disrupt his penance again by sending the Apsara Rambha.
