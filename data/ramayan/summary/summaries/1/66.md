**Chapter Title** : The Episode of the Bow

King Janaka welcomes Sage Vishwamitra and the princes, Rama and Lakshmana. Vishwamitra requests to see the great bow of Lord Shiva. Janaka narrates the history of the bow, which was given to his ancestor by Lord Shiva. He explains that his daughter Sita was found while plowing the field and is to be given in marriage to the one who can string the bow. Many kings tried but failed to lift the bow. Janaka promises Sita's hand to Rama if he can string the bow.
