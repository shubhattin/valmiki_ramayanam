## पायसोत्पत्तिः (pAyasOtpattiH)
**Chapter Title** : The Emergence of the Divine Dessert

The gods request Vishnu to take a human form to defeat Ravana. Ravana had a boon that he could not be killed by gods, demons, or spirits, but he underestimated humans. Vishnu agrees and chooses King Dasharatha as his father. King Dasharatha performs a sacrifice to have children. A divine being emerges from the fire with a bowl of divine dessert. The dessert is given to Dasharatha's wives, who consume it and become pregnant. The palace is filled with joy as the queens are blessed with children.
