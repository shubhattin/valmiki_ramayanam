## पायसोत्पत्तिः (pAyasOtpattiH)

**Chapter Title** : The Emergence of the Divine Nectar

1. The Devas, led by Indra, approach Lord Vishnu to seek a solution for the destruction of the demon king Ravana, who has become a menace to the three worlds.
2. Lord Vishnu, understanding the plight of the Devas, agrees to incarnate as a human to defeat Ravana, as Ravana had a boon that protected him from all beings except humans.
3. King Dasharatha of Ayodhya, who is childless, performs a sacrifice to beget progeny.
4. During the sacrifice, a divine being emerges from the sacrificial fire, carrying a golden vessel filled with divine nectar (payasam).
5. The divine being instructs King Dasharatha to distribute the nectar among his queens to conceive sons.
6. King Dasharatha gives half of the nectar to Queen Kausalya, a quarter to Queen Sumitra, and the remaining quarter to Queen Kaikeyi.
7. The queens consume the nectar, and in due course, they become pregnant, leading to the birth of Lord Rama and his brothers.
8. The emergence of the divine nectar signifies the divine intervention and the forthcoming birth of Lord Vishnu in human form to restore dharma.
