**Chapter Title** : Protection of the Sacrifice

Rama and Lakshmana, eager to fight, ask sage Vishwamitra when the demons will attack. The sage tells them to guard the sacrifice for six nights. The princes stay awake, protecting the hermitage. On the sixth day, the demons Maricha and Subahu attack. Rama uses a powerful weapon to send Maricha far away. He kills Subahu and other demons with another weapon. The sages praise Rama for saving the sacrifice. Vishwamitra is pleased and thanks Rama for fulfilling his duty.
