**Chapter Title** : The Cleaving of the Earth

1. After hearing the words of Sage Vishwamitra, Rama, the delight of the Raghu dynasty, expressed his desire to hear the detailed story of how his ancestor, King Sagara, conducted a sacrifice.
2. Sage Vishwamitra, pleased with Rama's curiosity, began narrating the tale of the great King Sagara, whose sacrifice was interrupted.
3. The sage described the land between the Himalayas and the Vindhya mountains as a sacred place for sacrifices.
4. King Sagara's grandson, Anshuman, was tasked with protecting the sacrificial horse, which was stolen by a demon in disguise.
5. The priests informed King Sagara about the theft, urging him to recover the horse to prevent the sacrifice from being incomplete.
6. King Sagara commanded his sixty thousand sons to search for the horse across the earth, digging the land as they went.
7. The sons, mighty and determined, began to dig the earth, causing great disturbance and noise, affecting various beings including Nagas, Asuras, and Rakshasas.
8. The sons dug through the earth, reaching the netherworld, causing alarm among the gods, Gandharvas, Asuras, and serpents.
9. The deities, distressed by the destruction, approached Lord Brahma, seeking his intervention to stop the sons of Sagara from further harm.
