## सिद्धाश्रमः (siddhAshramaH)
**Chapter Title** : Siddhashrama

Vishwamitra begins narrating the story of Siddhashrama to Rama. Vishnu once resided here for many years to perform penance. The place is known as Siddhashrama because of the great penance performed by Vishnu. King Bali, a powerful demon king, was performing a grand sacrifice. The gods, led by Agni, approached Vishnu for help. Vishnu took the form of Vamana, a dwarf, to subdue Bali. Vamana asked for three paces of land and covered the universe in three steps, restoring the gods' power. Vishwamitra and the princes arrive at Siddhashrama, where they are welcomed by the sages.
