## अम्बरीशयज्ञः (ambarIshayajnaH)

**Chapter Title** : Ambarisha's Sacrifice

1. King Ambarisha, renowned for his great fame, took Shunahshepa, a noble boy, and rested at Pushkara at midday.
2. Shunahshepa, distressed and weary, approached his maternal uncle, the sage Vishwamitra, who was engaged in penance with other sages.
3. Shunahshepa, with a sorrowful face, fell into the lap of the sage and pleaded for protection, stating he had no parents or relatives.
4. He requested Vishwamitra to save him, as he was the protector of all, and expressed his desire to live a long life and attain heaven through penance.
5. Vishwamitra, after consoling Shunahshepa, addressed his sons, urging them to save the boy by offering him in place of the sacrificial animal for King Ambarisha's sacrifice.
6. The sons of Vishwamitra, led by Madhuchhanda, refused, questioning why they should save another's son over their own.
7. Angered by their refusal, Vishwamitra cursed his sons to live on earth for a thousand years, eating dog meat like the Vasishthas.
8. Vishwamitra then instructed Shunahshepa to recite two divine hymns during the sacrifice, ensuring his protection and success.
9. Shunahshepa, with the hymns, approached King Ambarisha and urged him to proceed with the sacrifice.
10. The king, pleased and with the consent of the assembly, bound Shunahshepa as the sacrificial animal, adorned in red garments.
11. Shunahshepa praised Indra and Agni with the hymns, pleasing the gods.
12. Indra, gratified by the secret praise, granted Shunahshepa long life.
13. King Ambarisha successfully completed the sacrifice, receiving abundant rewards through Indra's grace.
14. Vishwamitra continued his penance at Pushkara for another thousand years, further enhancing his spiritual power.
