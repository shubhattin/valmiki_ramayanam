**Chapter Title** : Acquisition of the Science of Weapons by Vishvamitra

Vishvamitra's army was defeated by Vasistha's mystical powers. Vasistha created warriors from his breath to fight Vishvamitra's forces. Vishvamitra's sons attacked Vasistha in anger. Vasistha destroyed them with a hum sound. Vishvamitra felt humiliated and powerless. He left his kingdom and went to the Himalayas to meditate. Shiva granted him the knowledge of divine weapons.
