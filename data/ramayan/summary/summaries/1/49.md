**Chapter Title** : Ahalya's Liberation from Curse

1. Indra, having disrupted the penance of the great sage Gautama, faced the consequences of his actions and sought the help of other deities to regain his lost powers.
2. The deities, led by Agni, approached the Pitris (ancestral deities) and requested them to restore Indra's virility by using the testicles of a ram.
3. The Pitris agreed and transferred the ram's testicles to Indra, thus restoring his powers.
4. From that time, the Pitris began consuming the testicles of rams as offerings, which became a tradition.
5. Indra, now restored, was still under the influence of Gautama's curse, which could only be lifted by the presence of Rama.
6. Sage Vishwamitra guided Rama and Lakshmana to Gautama's hermitage to liberate Ahalya from her curse.
7. Ahalya, who had been invisible due to the curse, became visible upon Rama's arrival, signifying the end of her curse.
8. Rama and Lakshmana respectfully touched Ahalya's feet, and she welcomed them with due hospitality.
9. Ahalya was purified and restored to her original form, and the gods celebrated her liberation with a shower of flowers and music.
10. Sage Gautama, reunited with Ahalya, resumed his penance with great joy and satisfaction.
11. Rama, having fulfilled his duty, received blessings from Gautama and continued his journey to Mithila.
