**Chapter Title** : Ahalya's Curse Redemption

Indra, after disrupting sage Gautama's penance, seeks help from other gods. The gods decide to help Indra by restoring his lost virility using a ram's testicles. Ahalya, cursed by Gautama, becomes invisible to the world. Vishwamitra guides Rama and Lakshmana to Gautama's hermitage. Rama's presence ends Ahalya's curse, making her visible again. Ahalya welcomes Rama and Lakshmana with hospitality. The gods celebrate Ahalya's redemption, and Gautama returns to live with her.
