## देवान्तकादिवधः (dEvAntakAdivadhaH)
**Chapter Title** : The Slaying of Devantaka and Others

The demon chiefs, Devantaka, Trishira, and Mahodara, attack Angada, the son of Vali. Angada fights back fiercely, uprooting trees and hurling them at the demons. Hanuman and Nila join the battle to support Angada. Hanuman kills Devantaka with a powerful punch to the head. Nila kills Mahodara by smashing him with a mountain peak. Hanuman then fights Trishira, eventually beheading him with a sharp weapon. The defeat of these demon chiefs causes the remaining demon army to flee in fear.
