## ओषधिपर्वतानयनम् (OShadhiparvatAnayanam)
**Chapter Title** : Bringing the Mountain of Herbs

In the battle, the Vanara army was disheartened as many were injured. Vibhishana encouraged them with wise words. Hanuman and Vibhishana searched for the injured Jambavan. Jambavan asked Hanuman to bring healing herbs from the Himalayas. Hanuman flew over the ocean to the Himalayas. He lifted the entire mountain of herbs when he couldn't identify the specific ones. Returning swiftly, the scent of the herbs revived the injured warriors. The Vanaras and the princes, Rama and Lakshmana, were healed and ready to fight again.
