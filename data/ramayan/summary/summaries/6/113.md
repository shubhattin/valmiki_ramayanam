## रावाणान्तःपुरपरिदेवनम् (rAvANAntaHpuraparidEvanam)
**Chapter Title** : Lamentation in Ravana's Inner Palace

Ravana's wives mourn his death after hearing he was killed by Rama. They rush out, ignoring attempts to stop them, and search for Ravana's body. Finding him dead, they cry out in grief, comparing their loss to a herd of elephants losing their leader. They lament that the once invincible Ravana, who instilled fear in gods and demons, was defeated by a human. They blame fate for their misfortune, acknowledging that Ravana's refusal to return Sita led to their downfall. The women express regret, wishing Ravana had listened to wise counsel.
