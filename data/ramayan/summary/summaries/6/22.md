## सेतुबन्धः (sEtubandhaH)
**Chapter Title** : Bridge Construction

Rama threatens to dry up the ocean if it doesn't allow his army to cross. The ocean god appears and suggests building a bridge. Nala, son of Vishwakarma, is chosen to construct the bridge. Monkeys gather materials and start building the bridge across the ocean. The bridge is completed in five days, stretching 100 yojanas long and 10 yojanas wide. Rama and his army cross the bridge to reach Lanka. The gods and sages praise Rama's feat.
