## लङ्कादर्शनम् (lankAdarshanam)
**Chapter Title** : Lanka's Splendor

The monkey warriors spent the night on Suvela mountain. In the morning, they saw the beautiful forests and gardens of Lanka. The forests were filled with various trees and flowers, resembling the divine gardens. The air was fragrant with flowers, and birds sang melodiously. The monkeys, led by Sugriva, entered Lanka, causing fear among animals. They saw the grand city of Lanka, protected by Ravana. The city was adorned with palaces and towers, shining like gold and silver. Rama, with the monkeys, was amazed by Lanka's beauty and grandeur.
