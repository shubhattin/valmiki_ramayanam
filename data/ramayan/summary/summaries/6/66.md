## वानरपर्यवस्थापनम् (vAnaraparyavasthApanam)
**Chapter Title** : Establishment of the Monkeys

Kumbhakarna, a giant with immense strength, leaps over the city walls and emerges from the city. His terrifying roar frightens the monkeys, causing them to flee. Angada, a prince, encourages the monkeys to remember their bravery and not to run away like ordinary monkeys. The monkeys gather courage and attack Kumbhakarna with trees and rocks, but he remains unfazed. Despite their efforts, many monkeys are injured or killed by Kumbhakarna. Angada motivates the remaining monkeys to stand firm and fight, reminding them of their noble lineage. The monkeys, inspired by Angada's words, prepare to face Kumbhakarna again with renewed determination.
