**Chapter Title** : The Slaying of Ravana

Matali reminded Rama to use the powerful weapon given by Agastya. Rama took the divine arrow, crafted by Brahma, and aimed it at Ravana. The arrow, filled with immense power, struck Ravana's heart, killing him instantly. Ravana's death caused panic among the remaining demons, who fled in fear. The monkeys rejoiced and celebrated Rama's victory. The gods showered flowers from the sky, praising Rama's triumph. Rama fulfilled his promise and brought peace to his allies.
