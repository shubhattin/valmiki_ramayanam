## विरूपाक्षवधः (virUpAkShavadhaH)
**Chapter Title** : The Slaying of Virupaksha

Ravana's arrows caused great harm to the monkeys, scattering them like leaves in the wind. The monkeys could not withstand the fierce attack and retreated in fear. Sugriva, seeing his army in disarray, took charge and led a counterattack. He fought bravely, using trees as weapons, and caused chaos among the demons. Virupaksha, a powerful demon, challenged Sugriva by riding an elephant. Sugriva, with great strength, defeated the elephant and then faced Virupaksha directly. In a fierce battle, Sugriva killed Virupaksha, bringing victory to the monkeys.
