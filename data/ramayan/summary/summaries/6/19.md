Vibhishana, Ravana's brother, seeks refuge with Rama after being mistreated by Ravana. He pledges his loyalty to Rama and informs him about Ravana's strengths and weaknesses. Rama promises to defeat Ravana and make Vibhishana the king of Lanka. Vibhishana is crowned king by Lakshmana on Rama's orders. The Vanaras rejoice at this decision.
