## राक्षसीविलापः (rAkShasIvilApaH)
**Chapter Title** : Lament of the Demonesses

The demonesses gather, grieving the loss of their kin in battle. They blame Shurpanakha for provoking Rama, leading to the war. They recall the strength of Rama, who defeated many demons. They lament Ravana's actions, which brought destruction. They fear Rama's power, believing no one can save them. They remember prophecies of their doom. They feel hopeless, seeing no escape from their fate.
