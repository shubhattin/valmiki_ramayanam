## सुग्रीवभेदनोपायः (sugrIvabhedanOpAyaH)
**Chapter Title** : Sugriva's Persuasion Strategy

Ravana's spy, Shardula, observes Sugriva's army and reports back to Ravana. He warns Ravana about the approaching army led by Rama and Lakshmana. Ravana sends his messenger, Shuka, to Sugriva with a message. Shuka delivers Ravana's message to Sugriva, but the monkeys capture him. Rama instructs the monkeys not to harm Shuka, as he is just a messenger. Sugriva responds to Ravana's message with a strong warning. Angada, Sugriva's ally, suggests capturing Shuka, but Rama orders his release.
