## हनूमदादिनिर्वेदः (hanUmadAdinirvEdaH)
**Chapter Title** : Hanuman's Despair

Hanuman encourages the frightened monkeys to fight bravely against the demons. The monkeys, inspired by Hanuman, gather rocks and trees to attack the demons. Hanuman leads the charge, causing destruction among the demon ranks. He throws a large rock at Indrajit's chariot, but it misses. The monkeys continue their assault, throwing trees and rocks at the demons. Indrajit retaliates with his weapons, causing significant damage to the monkeys. Hanuman realizes the futility of the battle and decides to inform Rama and Sugriva about Sita's death. Meanwhile, Indrajit performs a ritual to gain more power.
