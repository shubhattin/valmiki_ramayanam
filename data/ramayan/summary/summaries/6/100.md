**Chapter Title** : The Sequence of Weapons between Rama and Ravana

Ravana, enraged by the death of his warriors, decides to fight Rama and Lakshmana himself. He compares Rama to a tree bearing Sita as its fruit and the monkey chiefs as its branches. Ravana's chariot fills the air with noise, causing fear among animals. He uses a powerful weapon that scatters the monkeys. Rama and Lakshmana stand firm, ready to fight. A fierce battle ensues between Rama and Ravana, with both displaying great skill. Ravana uses a terrifying weapon, but Rama counters it with his own, destroying Ravana's weapon. The monkeys cheer as Rama's weapon prevails.
