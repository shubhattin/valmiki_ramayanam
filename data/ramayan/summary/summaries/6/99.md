**Chapter Title** : The Slaying of Mahaparsva

Mahaparsva, a powerful demon, attacks Sugriva's army. He causes chaos among the Vanaras with his arrows. Angada, seeing the distress, fights back with great force. He uses a metal club to strike Mahaparsva. Mahaparsva, regaining consciousness, attacks Angada and Jambavan with arrows. Angada, in anger, throws a heavy club at Mahaparsva. The club knocks down Mahaparsva's weapons. Angada then strikes Mahaparsva with a powerful punch, killing him. The Vanaras celebrate their victory with loud roars.
