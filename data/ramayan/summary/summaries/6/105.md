## दशग्रीवविघूर्णनम् (dashagrIvavighUrNanam)
**Chapter Title** : The Agitation of the Ten-Headed (Ravana)

Ravana, filled with anger, attacked Rama with a barrage of arrows. Despite the attack, Rama stood firm like a mountain. Enraged, Rama taunted Ravana for his cowardly acts. Rama's strength and determination increased, and he showered Ravana with arrows. Ravana's heart wavered as he was overwhelmed by Rama's assault. Ravana's charioteer, seeing his master's condition, withdrew him from the battlefield. Ravana was left powerless and defeated.
