## सारथिविज्ञेयम् (sArathivijnEyam)
**Chapter Title** : Charioteer's Wisdom

Ravana, in a fit of anger, scolds his charioteer for retreating during battle. He accuses the charioteer of cowardice and disloyalty. The charioteer calmly explains that he acted out of concern for Ravana's safety and the condition of the horses. He highlights the importance of understanding the battlefield and the signs of fatigue in warriors and horses. Ravana, realizing the wisdom in the charioteer's words, praises him. He orders the charioteer to drive the chariot back towards Rama. The charioteer complies, and the chariot returns to the battlefield.
