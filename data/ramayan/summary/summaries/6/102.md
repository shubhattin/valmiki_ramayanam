## लक्ष्मणसंजीवनम् (lakShmaNasanjIvanam)
**Chapter Title** : Revival of Lakshmana

Ravana strikes Lakshmana with a powerful weapon, leaving him severely wounded. Rama is deeply distressed seeing his brother in such a state. Sushena, the healer, assures Rama that Lakshmana is not dead. He instructs Hanuman to fetch a life-saving herb from a distant mountain. Unable to identify the herb, Hanuman brings the entire mountain peak. Sushena uses the herb to revive Lakshmana. Lakshmana quickly recovers and stands up, ready to fight again. Rama is relieved and embraces Lakshmana with joy.
