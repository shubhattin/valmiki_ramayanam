**Chapter Title** : The Slaying of Nikumbha

Nikumbha sees his brother killed by Sugriva and becomes furious. He picks up a powerful mace and prepares to fight. Hanuman stands ready to face Nikumbha's attack. Nikumbha strikes Hanuman with the mace, but Hanuman remains unmoved. Hanuman retaliates with a mighty punch, injuring Nikumbha. Despite being grabbed by Nikumbha, Hanuman frees himself and lifts Nikumbha. Hanuman then tears off Nikumbha's head, ending the battle. The Vanaras rejoice, and the Rakshasas are filled with fear.
