**Chapter Title** : The Strategy to Tempt Sita

Ravana's advisor, Mahodara, criticizes Kumbhakarna for his arrogance and lack of understanding. He argues that Kumbhakarna's plan to fight Rama alone is foolish. Mahodara suggests a deceitful plan to announce the false death of Rama and Lakshmana. He proposes to use this lie to convince Sita that her husband is dead. Mahodara believes that Sita, in despair, will eventually submit to Ravana. He advises Ravana to tempt Sita with wealth and comfort. The plan aims to break Sita's spirit and make her accept Ravana.
