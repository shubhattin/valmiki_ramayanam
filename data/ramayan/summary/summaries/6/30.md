## वानरबलसंख्यानम् (vAnarabalasankhyAnam)
**Chapter Title** : Counting of the Vanara Forces

Ravana's spies inform him about Rama's army at Suvela mountain. Ravana is worried and questions his spy, who reports the strength of the Vanaras. The spy describes the Vanaras as strong and protected by Rama. He mentions being captured and beaten by the Vanaras but spared by Rama. The spy advises Ravana to either return Sita or prepare for battle. Ravana refuses to return Sita, even if faced by gods. The spy lists the powerful Vanara leaders and their divine lineage. He also mentions Rama's unmatched strength and his brother Lakshmana's prowess. Vibhishana, Ravana's brother, is also with Rama, supporting him.
