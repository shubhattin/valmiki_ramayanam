**Chapter Title** : Ravana's Spear Destruction

Rama becomes extremely angry, scaring all beings and shaking the earth. The gods, demons, and celestial beings watch the fierce battle. Ravana, filled with rage, grabs a terrifying spear to attack Rama. He boasts that the spear will kill Rama and his allies. Ravana throws the spear at Rama, but Rama counters with his arrows. The spear is destroyed by Rama's divine weapon. Rama then attacks Ravana's chariot and wounds him with sharp arrows. Ravana, bleeding and furious, feels exhausted but continues to fight.
