## इन्द्रजिन्मायायुद्धम् (indrajinmAyAyuddham)
**Chapter Title** : Indrajit's Illusory Battle

Indrajit, son of Ravana, consoles his grieving father after the loss of his brothers in battle. He assures Ravana of his own prowess and promises to defeat Rama and Lakshmana. Indrajit performs a ritual to invoke a powerful weapon and becomes invisible. He attacks the Vanara army with a rain of arrows, causing chaos and destruction. The Vanaras, led by Hanuman and others, fight back bravely but are overwhelmed. Indrajit uses his illusionary powers to strike Rama and Lakshmana, rendering them unconscious. Believing them defeated, Indrajit returns to Lanka, confident of his victory.
