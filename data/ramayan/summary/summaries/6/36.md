**Chapter Title** : Defense of the City Gates

Ravana, angry and under the influence of fate, dismisses Malyavan's wise advice. He questions Malyavan's support for Rama, a mere human. Ravana boasts of his own power and refuses to return Sita. He plans to defeat Rama and his army. Malyavan, feeling ashamed, leaves without arguing. Ravana then organizes the defense of Lanka's gates, assigning commanders to each direction. Confident in his plans, Ravana feels prepared for battle.
