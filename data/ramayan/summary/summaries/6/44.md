**Chapter Title** : Night Battle

The night battle between the Vanaras and Rakshasas begins as the sun sets. Both sides are eager for victory and fight fiercely in the darkness. The Rakshasas, with their golden armor, appear like mountains with glowing herbs. The Vanaras and Rakshasas attack each other with great ferocity. Rama and Lakshmana use their arrows to defeat many Rakshasas. The battlefield becomes a river of blood, with the sounds of drums and conch shells echoing. Indrajit, Ravana's son, uses his magic to become invisible and binds Rama and Lakshmana with serpent-like arrows.
