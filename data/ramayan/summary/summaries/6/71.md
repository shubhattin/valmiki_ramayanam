## अतिकायवधः (atikAyavadhaH)
**Chapter Title** : The Slaying of Atikaya

Atikaya, a powerful demon, sees his army and brothers defeated. Enraged, he enters the battlefield with a radiant chariot. Atikaya's presence terrifies the monkeys, who seek refuge with Rama. Vibhishana identifies Atikaya as Ravana's son, invincible to gods and demons. Atikaya challenges the warriors, and Lakshmana accepts. A fierce battle ensues, with both exchanging powerful arrows. Lakshmana uses a divine Brahmastra to pierce Atikaya's armor. Atikaya's head is severed, and the demons flee. The monkeys celebrate Lakshmana's victory.
