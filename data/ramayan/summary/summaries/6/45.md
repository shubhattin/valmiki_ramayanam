## नागपाशबन्धः (nAgapAshabandhaH)
**Chapter Title** : Binding with Serpent Noose

Rama, the valiant prince, sends ten monkey chiefs to search for Ravana. Indrajit, Ravana's son, uses powerful arrows to stop them. The monkeys, unable to see in the dark, are hit by Indrajit's arrows. Indrajit targets Rama and Lakshmana, binding them with serpent-like arrows. Both brothers are severely wounded and fall unconscious. Indrajit boasts about his victory, claiming even gods can't defeat him. The monkeys, led by Hanuman, are distressed seeing Rama and Lakshmana wounded.
