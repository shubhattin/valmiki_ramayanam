## सीताप्रत्यादेशः (sItApratyAdEshaH)
**Chapter Title** : Sita's Rejection

Rama sees Sita standing humbly by his side. He expresses his feelings about defeating the enemy and fulfilling his duty. Rama acknowledges the efforts of Hanuman, Sugriva, and Vibhishana in the battle. He tells Sita that he has cleared his honor and doubts about her purity. Rama declares he has no attachment to Sita and asks her to go wherever she wishes. Sita is deeply hurt by Rama's words and starts crying. She feels like a vine struck by an elephant's trunk.
