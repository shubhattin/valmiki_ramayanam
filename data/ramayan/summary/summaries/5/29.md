**Chapter Title** : Auspicious Omens

Sita, distressed and anxious, begins to see auspicious signs. Her left eye, arm, and thigh twitch, indicating good fortune. Her garment slips slightly, symbolizing hope. These omens suggest the arrival of Rama. Sita feels a renewed sense of hope and joy. Her face shines like the moon freed from an eclipse. She becomes calm and her worries fade away.
