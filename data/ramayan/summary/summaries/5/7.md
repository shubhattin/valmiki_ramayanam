## पुष्पकदर्शनम् (puShpakadarshanam)
**Chapter Title** : Pushpaka's Appearance

Hanuman sees Ravana's grand palace, adorned with gold and jewels, resembling a cloud in the rainy season. The palace is filled with various halls and rooms, beautifully constructed and free from any flaws. It appears like a piece of heaven on earth, shining with many gems and flowers. The palace is surrounded by gardens, lakes, and forests, all artistically designed. Hanuman notices the Pushpaka Vimana, a magnificent flying chariot, shining with precious stones. Despite the beauty, Hanuman feels sorrow as he searches for Sita, who is held captive by Ravana.
