**Chapter Title** : Exploration of the Drinking Hall

Hanuman dismisses his initial thoughts and focuses on finding Sita. He believes Sita cannot enjoy life without Rama. Hanuman explores the drinking hall, observing exhausted women from dancing and singing. He sees Ravana among the women, like a bull among cows. The hall is filled with various meats and drinks. Hanuman notices the luxurious setting and sleeping women. Despite seeing many women, he doesn't find Sita. Hanuman worries about the morality of observing Ravana's women but reassures himself of his pure intentions.
