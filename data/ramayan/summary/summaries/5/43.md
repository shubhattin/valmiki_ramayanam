**Chapter Title** : Destruction of the Chaitya Hall

Hanuman decides to destroy the Chaitya Hall after defeating the guards. He leaps onto the tall structure, resembling a mountain peak. Hanuman, with immense energy, makes a loud noise, filling Lanka with sound. The guards, armed with weapons, surround him. In anger, Hanuman uproots a pillar and sets the hall on fire. He defeats a hundred demons and declares the strength of the Vanaras. Hanuman warns that Sugriva's army will soon arrive to destroy Lanka.
