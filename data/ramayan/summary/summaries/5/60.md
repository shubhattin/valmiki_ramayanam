## अङ्गदजाम्बवत्संवादः (angadajAmbavatsaMvAdaH)
**Chapter Title** : Dialogue between Angada and Jambavan

Angada, son of Vali, speaks with confidence about the strength of the monkey warriors. He mentions the invincibility granted to the Ashwini twins by Brahma. Angada believes they can destroy Lanka and defeat Ravana. He suggests they can rescue Sita and return victorious. Jambavan, the wise bear, advises against this plan. He reminds Angada that their mission was to find Sita, not to fight. Jambavan suggests reporting back to Rama and Sugriva first.
