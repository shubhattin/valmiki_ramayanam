## राक्षसीपरिवारः (rAkShasIparivAraH)
**Chapter Title** : The Demoness Entourage

The moon rose in the sky, illuminating the night. Hanuman, the son of the wind god, saw Sita, who was sad and surrounded by demonesses. These demonesses had terrifying appearances, with various deformities. Sita looked like a fallen star, distressed and without her husband. Hanuman observed her sorrow and felt immense compassion. He was determined to help her and was filled with hope.
