## पावकशैत्यम् (pAvakashaityam)
**Chapter Title** : Cooling of Fire

Ravana, the ten-headed demon king, listens to his brother's advice. He decides not to kill Hanuman, the monkey messenger. Instead, he orders Hanuman's tail to be set on fire. The demons wrap Hanuman's tail with cloth and set it ablaze. Hanuman, with his burning tail, jumps around the city of Lanka. Sita prays for Hanuman's safety, and the fire does not harm him. Hanuman realizes the fire's coolness is due to Sita's prayers and Rama's power. He breaks free from his bonds and escapes.
