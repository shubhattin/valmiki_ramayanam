## दूतवधनिवारणम् (dUtavadhanivAraNam)
**Chapter Title** : Prevention of the Messenger's Execution

Ravana orders the execution of Hanuman, the monkey messenger. Vibhishana opposes the decision, arguing it is against dharma and tradition. He advises Ravana to reconsider, as killing a messenger is not honorable. Vibhishana suggests punishing Hanuman in other ways instead. Ravana, filled with anger, initially disagrees but listens to Vibhishana's wise counsel. Vibhishana emphasizes the importance of adhering to righteous conduct. Ravana ultimately accepts Vibhishana's advice and spares Hanuman's life.
