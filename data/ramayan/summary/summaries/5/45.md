## अमात्यपुत्रवधः (amAtyaputravadhaH)
**Chapter Title** : Killing of the Minister's Sons

The minister's sons, urged by the demon king, set out with a large army. They were skilled warriors, eager for victory. Their chariots were adorned with flags and made thunderous sounds. Hanuman faced them bravely, standing on a gate. The demons attacked with a rain of arrows, but Hanuman dodged them skillfully. He fought fiercely, using his hands, feet, and nails to defeat the demons. The demon army was terrified and fled in all directions. Hanuman returned to the gate, ready to fight more demons.
