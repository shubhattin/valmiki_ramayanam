## वायसवृत्तान्तकथनम् (vAyasavRttAntakathanam)
**Chapter Title** : The Story of the Crow

Hanuman is pleased with Sita's words and acknowledges her wisdom. He assures her that he will convey her message to Rama. Sita recounts an incident with a crow, the son of Indra, who attacked her. Rama, in anger, used a divine weapon to punish the crow. The crow sought refuge with Rama, who spared its life but injured its eye. Sita expresses her sorrow and questions why Rama and Lakshmana have not rescued her yet. Hanuman consoles her, promising that Rama will soon defeat Ravana and rescue her. Sita gives Hanuman a jewel to show Rama as proof of their meeting.
