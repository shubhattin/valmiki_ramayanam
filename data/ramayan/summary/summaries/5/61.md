## मधुवनप्रवेशः (madhuvanapravEshaH)
**Chapter Title** : Entry into the Honey Forest

The monkeys, led by Angada and Hanuman, joyfully leap from Mahendra Mountain. They reach the beautiful Madhuvana, protected by Sugriva's uncle, Dadhimukha. The monkeys, excited, ask Angada for permission to enjoy the honey. Angada grants permission, and they indulge in the honey, becoming ecstatic. Dadhimukha tries to stop them, but the monkeys, in their frenzy, overpower him. The monkeys celebrate, singing and dancing, in the forest.
