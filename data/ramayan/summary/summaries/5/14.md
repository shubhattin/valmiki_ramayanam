**Chapter Title** : Exploration of Ashoka Grove

Hanuman pauses briefly and then leaps over the wall of the mansion. He sees various blossoming trees like Sal, Ashoka, and Champaka. The grove is filled with birds and animals, creating a lively atmosphere. Hanuman searches for Sita, waking up sleeping birds. The flowers fall like rain as he moves through the grove. The earth appears decorated with fallen flowers. Hanuman notices the beauty of the grove and thinks Sita might visit the river. He decides to wait and watch for her arrival.
