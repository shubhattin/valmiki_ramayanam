## किंकरनिषूदनम् (kinkaraniShUdanam)
**Chapter Title** : Destruction of the Kinkaras

The residents of Lanka were alarmed by the noise of breaking trees and the cries of birds. The demonesses saw the mighty Hanuman and were frightened. They questioned Sita about Hanuman's identity, but she claimed ignorance. The demonesses reported to Ravana about the powerful monkey in the Ashoka grove. Ravana, enraged, sent the Kinkaras to capture Hanuman. Hanuman, with great strength, defeated the Kinkaras using a metal bar. He declared his allegiance to Rama and his mission to find Sita. The surviving demons reported back to Ravana.
