## कृच्छ्रगतसीतोपमाः (kRchChragatasItOpamAH)
**Chapter Title** : The Plight of Sita

Ravana approaches Sita, who is in distress. Sita is scared and trembling like a banana plant in the wind. She covers herself modestly and sits crying. Ravana sees her guarded by demonesses, looking like a broken branch. Sita is compared to a faded lotus and a night without the moon. She is like a river dried up, suffering from separation from Rama. Ravana tries to tempt Sita, but she remains devoted to Rama.
