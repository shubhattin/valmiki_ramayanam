**Chapter Title** : Slaying of the Five Army Generals

Ravana, angered by the defeat of his ministers' sons, sends five army generals to capture Hanuman. The generals, equipped with chariots, elephants, and horses, attack Hanuman. Hanuman fights back fiercely, leaping into the sky and destroying their chariots. He kills the generals one by one using his immense strength. Hanuman uproots a mountain peak and crushes two of the generals. The remaining generals are also defeated by Hanuman. Finally, Hanuman destroys the rest of the army, leaving the battlefield filled with debris.
