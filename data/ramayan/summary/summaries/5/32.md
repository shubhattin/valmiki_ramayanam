**Chapter Title** : Sita's Doubt

Sita sees a monkey hidden in the branches, wrapped in a cloth. The monkey is Hanuman, who appears gentle and speaks kindly. Sita is amazed and confused by Hanuman's presence. She is frightened and cries out for Rama and Lakshmana. Sita wonders if she is dreaming, as she is overwhelmed by emotions. She doubts the reality of the situation, thinking it might be a vision. Sita prays for the well-being of Rama, Lakshmana, and her father, King Janaka.
