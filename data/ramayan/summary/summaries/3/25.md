## खरसैन्यावमर्दः (kharasainyAvamardaH)
**Chapter Title** : Destruction of Khara's Army

Khara arrives at the hermitage with his army to confront Rama. Seeing Rama ready with his bow, Khara orders his charioteer to advance. The demons surround Rama, attacking him with various weapons. Despite being wounded, Rama remains unshaken and retaliates with a barrage of arrows. Rama's arrows, like deadly nooses, decimate the demon army. The surviving demons, terrified, seek refuge with Khara. Dushana, Khara's ally, rallies the demons for another attack. Rama uses a powerful weapon, the Gandharva Astra, to annihilate the remaining demons. The battlefield is strewn with the bodies of slain demons and their mounts.
