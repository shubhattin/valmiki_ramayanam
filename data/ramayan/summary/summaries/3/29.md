## खरगदाभेदनम् (kharagadAbhEdanam)
**Chapter Title** : Breaking of Khara's Mace

Rama confronts Khara, who is now without his chariot and holding a mace. Rama criticizes Khara for his cruel actions and warns him of the consequences. He tells Khara that evil deeds lead to downfall, just like a tree with weak roots. Rama vows to avenge the sages killed by Khara. Khara, angered by Rama's words, boasts about his strength. He throws his mace at Rama, but Rama shatters it with his arrows. The broken mace falls to the ground, defeated by Rama's skill.
