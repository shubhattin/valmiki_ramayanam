Rama kills the demon Maricha, who was disguised as a golden deer. As Rama hurries back to see Sita, he hears an ominous jackal howl. He worries about Sita's safety, suspecting danger from demons. Maricha, before dying, mimics Rama's voice to mislead Lakshmana. Lakshmana leaves Sita to find Rama, fearing for his safety. Rama returns to the hermitage, anxious and troubled by bad omens. He meets Lakshmana and scolds him for leaving Sita alone.
