## त्रिशिरोवधः (trishirOvadhaH)
**Chapter Title** : Trishira's Slaying

Trishira, a demon, offers to fight Rama instead of Khara. He promises to kill Rama and prove his strength. Khara agrees and sends Trishira to battle. Trishira attacks Rama with a chariot and arrows. Rama fights back fiercely, cutting down Trishira's horses and charioteer. Rama then beheads Trishira with his arrows. The remaining demons flee in fear. Khara, enraged, charges at Rama like Rahu attacking the moon.
