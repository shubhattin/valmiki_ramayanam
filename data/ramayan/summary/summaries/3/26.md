## दूषणादिवधः (dUShaNAdivadhaH)
**Chapter Title** : Slaying of Dushana and Others

Dushana saw his army being destroyed and ordered 5,000 fierce demons to attack Rama. They attacked with various weapons, but Rama countered with sharp arrows. Enraged, Rama decided to kill all the demons. He shot arrows at Dushana, cutting off his arms and killing him. Three more demon leaders attacked Rama, but he killed them swiftly. Rama then killed 14,000 demons in total. Only Khara, Trishira, and Rama remained on the battlefield. Khara prepared to fight Rama with great fury.
