**Chapter Title** : The Story of Kabandha's Curse

Kabandha, once a powerful being, had a terrifying form that frightened sages. He was cursed by a sage named Sthulashira to have a hideous form. Kabandha was told that his curse would end when Rama cut off his arms and burned him. Kabandha explained to Rama that he was once a son of Danu and had angered Indra, who struck him down. Indra told him that he would regain his original form when Rama and Lakshmana cut off his arms. Kabandha advised Rama to seek help from Sugriva to find Sita. He promised to guide Rama to someone who could help him after being burned. Kabandha urged Rama to act before sunset to fulfill the prophecy.
