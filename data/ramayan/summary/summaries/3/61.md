**Chapter Title** : Search for Sita

Rama returns to find the hermitage empty and Sita missing. He is distraught and questions Lakshmana about her whereabouts. Rama laments and expresses his inability to live without Sita. Lakshmana tries to console Rama and suggests searching the forest. They search the forest, mountains, and rivers but do not find Sita. Rama is overwhelmed with grief and despair. Lakshmana reassures Rama that they will find Sita, just as Vishnu found the earth after defeating Bali. Despite Lakshmana's comfort, Rama continues to mourn for Sita.
