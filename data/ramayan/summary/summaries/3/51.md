## जटायुरावणयुद्धम् (jaTAyurAvaNayuddham)
**Chapter Title** : Battle Between Jatayu and Ravana

Ravana, with fiery eyes, attacked Jatayu in a fierce battle. The fight was intense, like a storm in the sky. Jatayu bravely defended against Ravana's arrows. He used his claws to wound Ravana. Ravana, in anger, shot sharp arrows at Jatayu. Jatayu broke Ravana's bow with his feet. Despite being tired, Jatayu continued to fight. Ravana eventually cut off Jatayu's wings, causing him to fall to the ground. Sita, seeing Jatayu wounded, cried for him.
