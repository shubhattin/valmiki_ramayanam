## शूर्पनखाविरूपणम् (shUrpanakhAvirUpaNam)
**Chapter Title** : Mutilation of Shurpanakha

Rama gently rejects Shurpanakha's advances, saying he is married. He suggests she approach his brother, Lakshmana. Shurpanakha, infatuated, turns to Lakshmana. Lakshmana also rejects her, suggesting she be with Rama. Angered, Shurpanakha attacks Sita. Rama orders Lakshmana to disfigure Shurpanakha. Lakshmana cuts off her nose and ears. Shurpanakha, wounded, flees to her brother Khara.
