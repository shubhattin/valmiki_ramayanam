**Chapter Title** : Panchavati Leaf Cottage

Rama, Lakshmana, and Sita reach Panchavati, a beautiful forest area. Rama asks Lakshmana to find a suitable place for their hermitage. Lakshmana chooses a spot near a water source, surrounded by flowering trees. He builds a large, sturdy leaf cottage for them. Rama is pleased with Lakshmana's work and praises him. They perform rituals and settle in the cottage. The trio lives happily in the serene forest, like gods in heaven.
