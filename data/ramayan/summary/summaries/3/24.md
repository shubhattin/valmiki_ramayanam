**Chapter Title** : Rama's Encounter with Khara's Army

Rama and Lakshmana notice ominous signs as Khara approaches the ashram. Rama predicts a great battle and instructs Lakshmana to take Sita to a safe cave. Rama prepares for battle, donning armor and taking up his bow. Gods and sages gather to witness the battle. Rama stands alone against Khara's massive army. The forest creatures flee in fear as the battle begins. Rama's presence is compared to a fierce Rudra, ready to destroy the demons.
