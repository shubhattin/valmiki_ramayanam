**Chapter Title** : Ravana's Inquiry about Khara's Defeat

Akampana rushes to Lanka to inform Ravana about the defeat of Khara and other demons by Rama. Ravana, enraged, questions who could have done this. Akampana describes Rama's strength and advises Ravana to abduct Sita to weaken Rama. Ravana decides to follow this plan and sets out to meet Maricha. Maricha warns Ravana against provoking Rama, describing Rama's power and advising Ravana to enjoy his life in Lanka instead. Despite the warning, Ravana returns to Lanka, contemplating his next move.
