## उत्पातदर्शनम् (utpAtadarshanam)
**Chapter Title** : Ominous Signs

A terrifying army with blood-red waters advanced. Horses fell unexpectedly on the path. A huge vulture perched on a golden flag. Near Janasthana, flesh-eating animals made eerie sounds. Dark clouds resembling broken elephants filled the sky. The earth shook, and Khara's left arm trembled. Despite these omens, Khara laughed and dismissed them. He vowed to defeat Rama and Lakshmana.
