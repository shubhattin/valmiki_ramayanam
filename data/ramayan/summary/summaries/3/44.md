**Chapter Title** : Deception of Maricha

Rama instructs his brother and prepares for a hunt. He arms himself and sets out into the forest. Maricha, disguised as a golden deer, lures Rama away. Rama chases the deer, suspecting it might be a demon. He finally shoots the deer with a powerful arrow. Maricha, in his true form, cries out in Rama's voice. Rama realizes the trick and worries for Sita's safety. He hurries back to the hermitage.
