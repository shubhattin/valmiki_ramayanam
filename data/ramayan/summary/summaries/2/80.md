## मार्गसंस्कारः (mArgasaMskAraH)
**Chapter Title** : Path Preparation

The skilled workers and craftsmen began preparing the path for Bharata's journey. They cleared the land, cut down trees, and leveled the ground. Wells and water bodies were constructed along the way. The path was decorated with flowers and flags, resembling a heavenly path. Beautiful campsites with abundant fruits were set up for Bharata. The path was made to look like the city of Indra, with grand buildings and decorations. The path reached the river Ganges, surrounded by lush forests and clear waters.
