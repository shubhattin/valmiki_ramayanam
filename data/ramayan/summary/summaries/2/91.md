## भरद्वाजातिथ्यम् (bharadvAjAtithyam)
**Chapter Title** : Bharadvaja's Hospitality

Bharata, son of Kaikeyi, is invited by sage Bharadvaja to stay as a guest. Bharata humbly declines, saying the sage has already offered enough hospitality. Bharadvaja insists on hosting Bharata's entire army. Bharata explains he left his army at a distance to avoid disturbing the hermitage. Bharadvaja calls upon divine beings to provide a grand feast and entertainment for Bharata's army. The army enjoys divine food, drinks, and entertainment, feeling as if they are in heaven. The night passes joyfully, and the divine beings depart after the feast.
