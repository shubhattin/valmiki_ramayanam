**Chapter Title** : Viewing the Chitrakuta Forest

Bharata's large army frightened the forest animals. The army, like a sea, covered the land. Bharata, tired from travel, spoke to Vasistha. They reached the Chitrakuta mountain and Mandakini river. The forest appeared beautiful and serene. Bharata ordered his men to search for Rama and Lakshmana. They saw smoke, indicating human presence. Bharata decided to approach with Sumantra and Vasistha.
