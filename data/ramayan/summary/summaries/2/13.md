## दशरथविलापः (dasharathavilApaH)
**Chapter Title** : Lamentation of Dasharatha

King Dasharatha is deeply troubled and lies in a state of despair, feeling like he has fallen from grace. Queen Kaikeyi reminds him of his promise and demands her boon, causing him great distress. Dasharatha laments the thought of sending his beloved son Rama to the forest. He questions how he can exile Rama, who is virtuous and dear to him. The king is tormented by the idea of Rama's suffering and pleads with Kaikeyi to reconsider. Despite his pleas, Kaikeyi remains unmoved, and Dasharatha faints from grief. The night passes with the king in agony, unable to find peace.
