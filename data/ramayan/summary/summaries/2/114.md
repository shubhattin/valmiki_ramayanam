## अयोध्याप्रवेशः (ayOdhyApravEshaH)
**Chapter Title** : Ayodhya's Entry

Bharata enters Ayodhya with a deep, resonant sound of his chariot. The city appears dark and lifeless, like a night without stars. It resembles a river dried up, with no fish or birds. The city is compared to a battlefield, with broken chariots and fallen warriors. Bharata notices the absence of music and fragrance, indicating the city's sorrow. He laments the lack of joy and festivities in Ayodhya. Bharata longs for Rama's return to bring happiness back to the city.
