## अयोध्यागमनम् (ayOdhyAgamanam)
**Chapter Title** : Ayodhya's Return

Bharata leaves the royal palace and crosses the Shatadru River. He travels through various regions and rivers, including the Saraswati and Ganga. Bharata reaches the forest of the northern Matsyas and the Yamuna River. He refreshes his horses and continues his journey. Bharata crosses the Lohitya River and reaches the city of Kalinga. He travels through the forest and finally sees Ayodhya. Bharata notices the city is unusually quiet and devoid of its usual vibrancy. He enters Ayodhya, feeling anxious and worried about the ominous signs he observes.
