## दशरथौर्ध्वदैहिकम् (dasharathaurdhvadaihikam)

**Chapter Title** : Dasaratha's Obsequies

1. Sage Vasistha, a wise and eloquent sage, addresses Bharata, the son of Kaikeyi, who is overwhelmed with grief, urging him to perform the necessary rites for the deceased King Dasaratha.
2. Bharata, upon hearing Vasistha's words, regains his composure and begins to arrange for all the funeral rites, understanding his duty.
3. The body of King Dasaratha is lifted from the oil in which it was preserved and placed on the ground, appearing as if he were merely asleep.
4. The king is then laid on a splendid bed adorned with various jewels, and Bharata, deeply sorrowful, laments over his father's body.
5. Bharata questions the king's decision to exile the righteous Rama and the mighty Lakshmana, expressing his sorrow and confusion over the king's actions.
6. He wonders who will now take care of the kingdom's welfare with the king gone and Rama in the forest.
7. Bharata laments that the earth appears like a widow without the king, and the city seems dim like a night without the moon.
8. Sage Vasistha again advises Bharata to perform the king's funeral rites without delay.
9. Bharata, respecting Vasistha's counsel, hastens the priests and officiants to carry out the rituals.
10. The priests and sacrificial performers, who had been removed from the sacrificial chamber, proceed with the rites as prescribed.
11. The king's lifeless body is placed on a palanquin and carried by attendants, their throats choked with tears.
12. People scatter gold, silver, and various garments along the path as they proceed ahead of the king's body.
13. They gather sandalwood, aloe, pine, and other woods to construct the funeral pyre.
14. The priests place the king's body in the center of the pyre, offering various fragrant substances.
15. The priests perform the fire rituals, chanting hymns and singing Sama Veda hymns as per the scriptures.
16. The king's wives, accompanied by elders, leave the city in palanquins and chariots, as is appropriate.
17. The priests perform the rites for the king, and the women, led by Kausalya, are overwhelmed with grief.
18. The lamentations of the women resemble the cries of cranes, echoing sorrowfully.
19. The women, helpless and repeatedly lamenting, descend from their vehicles to the banks of the Sarayu River.
20. Along with Bharata, the king's wives and ministers perform the water oblations, their eyes filled with tears.
21. They return to the city, their eyes swollen with tears, and spend ten days in mourning, filled with sorrow.
