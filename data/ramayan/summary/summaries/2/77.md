## भरतशत्रुघ्नविलापः (bharatashatrughnavilApaH)

**Chapter Title** : Lamentation of Bharata and Shatrughna

1. After ten days had passed since the king's demise, Bharata, having completed the purification rites, performed the Shraddha ceremony on the twelfth day.
2. Bharata generously distributed wealth, food, and valuable garments to the Brahmins, along with numerous cows, servants, vehicles, and large houses.
3. Overcome with grief, Bharata lamented at the foot of his father's funeral pyre, expressing his sorrow for being left behind when Rama was sent to the forest.
4. Bharata questioned his father's departure, leaving Kausalya and the kingdom without guidance.
5. Shatrughna, witnessing Bharata's sorrow, also fell unconscious, overwhelmed by grief.
6. Both brothers, recalling their father's virtues, were deeply distressed by the circumstances caused by Kaikeyi and Manthara.
7. Bharata expressed his inability to return to Ayodhya and his desire to enter the forest, feeling bereft of his father and brother.
8. The royal priest Vasishta consoled Bharata, reminding him of the inevitability of life and death, and urged him to complete the remaining funeral rites.
9. Sumantra also consoled Shatrughna, explaining the cycle of life and death.
10. Both Bharata and Shatrughna, though exhausted and grief-stricken, were eventually consoled and rose, appearing like rain-soaked banners of Indra.
