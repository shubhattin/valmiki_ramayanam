## भरतशत्रुघ्नविलापः (bharatashatrughnavilApaH)
**Chapter Title** : Lamentation of Bharata and Shatrughna

Bharata performs the last rites for his father on the twelfth day after his death. He gives gifts to Brahmins, including wealth, food, and clothes. Bharata laments at his father's funeral pyre, feeling abandoned. Shatrughna also grieves deeply, remembering their father's virtues. Both brothers express their sorrow and feel lost without their father and brother Rama. Vasishta, the family priest, consoles them and reminds them of their duties. Bharata and Shatrughna, though distressed, are encouraged to continue their responsibilities.
