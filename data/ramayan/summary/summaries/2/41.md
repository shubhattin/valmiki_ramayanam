**Chapter Title** : The Disturbance in the City

1. As the noble prince Rama, revered as a tiger among men, departs with folded hands, a great wailing arises among the women in the inner chambers.
2. The people, feeling orphaned, weak, and ascetic, lament the loss of their protector and refuge, wondering where their lord is going.
3. Rama, who never gets angry even when provoked and who calms the anger of others, is leaving, causing distress among all.
4. The great soul, who treats Kausalya with the same respect as his own mother, is leaving, causing sorrow among the people.
5. Compelled by the king, who is influenced by Kaikeyi, Rama, the savior of the people and the world, is going to the forest.
6. The king, devoid of sense, is sending Rama, who is righteous and truthful, to the forest, leading to the destruction of the living world.
7. All the queens, like cows bereft of calves, cry out in distress and wail loudly.
8. The king, tormented by the grief of his son, hears the dreadful cries in the inner chambers and becomes deeply sorrowful.
9. The sacred fires are not kindled, householders do not cook, and people do not perform their duties; even the sun is obscured.
10. Elephants drop their food, cows do not feed their calves, and mothers do not rejoice at the birth of their firstborn.
11. The planets, including Trishanku, Lohitanga, Brihaspati, and Budha, ominously approach the moon.
12. Stars lose their brilliance, planets their luster, and smoky Visakha appears in the sky.
13. The city trembles like a great ocean stirred by a storm as Rama departs for the forest.
14. All directions are confused, shrouded in darkness, with no planet or star visible.
15. The entire city is suddenly engulfed in despair, with no one interested in food or recreation.
16. The people of Ayodhya, constantly sighing deeply, cry out to the king in their sorrow.
17. Faces filled with tears, the people on the royal road are not joyful; everyone is absorbed in grief.
18. The cool wind does not blow, the moon is not pleasant to look at, and the sun does not shine; the entire world is in turmoil.
19. Sons, husbands, and brothers of women, all abandon everything and think only of Rama.
20. Rama's friends, overwhelmed by grief, are unable to sleep.
21. Bereft of the great soul Rama, Ayodhya, like the earth without Indra, trembles in fear and sorrow, with elephants, warriors, and horses making a tumultuous noise.
