**Chapter Title** : City's Turmoil

As the noble prince Rama leaves, a great cry arises from the women in the palace. The people feel lost without their protector. Rama, who never gets angry and treats everyone equally, is leaving. The king, urged by Kaikeyi, sends Rama to the forest. The city of Ayodhya is in chaos, with people not performing daily rituals. The sky shows ominous signs, and the city trembles as if in an earthquake. Everyone is in deep sorrow, thinking only of Rama.
