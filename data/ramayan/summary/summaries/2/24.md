**Chapter Title** : Kausalya's Grief and Consolation

Kausalya is deeply saddened by Rama's decision to follow his father's orders. She worries about how Rama, who is used to comforts, will survive in the forest. Kausalya expresses her desire to accompany Rama, comparing herself to a cow following its calf. Rama consoles her, emphasizing the importance of obeying his father's command. He assures her that Bharata will take care of her. Rama advises Kausalya to serve King Dasharatha, as it is her duty. Kausalya reluctantly agrees, hoping for Rama's safe return.
