**Chapter Title** : Kausalya and Lakshmana's Awakening

1. Lakshmana expresses his discontent with the decision of Rama going to the forest, influenced by the words of a woman (Kaikeyi).
2. He questions the king's judgment, suggesting that the king is old and misguided by desires.
3. Lakshmana sees no fault in Rama that would justify his exile.
4. He declares his willingness to protect Rama and Ayodhya with his bow, even against Bharata or anyone supporting him.
5. Lakshmana suggests that if their father, King Dasharatha, is acting under Kaikeyi's influence, he should be restrained.
6. Kausalya, Rama's mother, is in deep sorrow and pleads with Rama not to leave her.
7. She emphasizes the importance of serving one's mother and compares her authority to that of the king.
8. Rama, however, insists on fulfilling his father's command, citing examples from their lineage where obedience to the father's word was paramount.
9. He reassures Kausalya that he will return after fulfilling his promise, just as King Yayati returned to heaven after completing his penance.
10. Rama advises Lakshmana to abandon thoughts of rebellion and adhere to the path of righteousness.
11. Despite Kausalya's pleas, Rama remains firm in his decision, seeking her blessings for his journey to the forest.
12. The sarga concludes with Rama's respectful farewell to his mother, as he prepares to leave for the forest, adhering to dharma and his father's command.
