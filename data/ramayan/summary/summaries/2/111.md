## भरतानुशासनम् (bharatAnushAsanam)
**Chapter Title** : Bharata's Counsel

Vasishta advises Rama on the importance of following the guidance of elders like teachers and parents. He emphasizes that by listening to Bharata, Rama will uphold righteousness. Rama acknowledges the debt to his parents and vows to honor his father's wishes. Bharata, distressed, decides to fast until Rama agrees to return to Ayodhya. Rama, however, insists on fulfilling his father's promise and encourages Bharata to rule Ayodhya. Bharata offers to stay in the forest instead, but Rama remains firm. Rama reassures everyone that he will return after his exile and rule with Bharata.
