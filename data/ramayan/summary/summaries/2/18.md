## वनवासनिर्देशः (vanavAsanirdEshaH)
**Chapter Title** : Exile Order

Rama sees his father, King Dasharatha, looking distressed and sitting with Kaikeyi. Rama respectfully greets his father and Kaikeyi. King Dasharatha, overwhelmed with emotion, cannot speak to Rama. Rama, concerned, asks Kaikeyi if he has done something wrong. Kaikeyi reveals that the king had promised her two boons, which she now claims. She demands Rama's exile to the forest for 14 years and Bharata's coronation. Rama, devoted to his father's word, agrees to fulfill Kaikeyi's demands without hesitation.
