**Chapter Title** : Awakening of Siddhartha

1. King Dasharatha, distressed by his promise, instructs Sumantra to prepare a grand procession for Rama's journey, including a well-equipped army and various resources.
2. He orders that merchants, entertainers, and those who serve Rama should accompany him, providing them with gifts and provisions.
3. The king commands that weapons, chariots, and skilled hunters should follow Rama to ensure his comfort in the forest.
4. Dasharatha expresses his desire for Rama to live comfortably in the forest, performing sacrifices and associating with sages.
5. Kaikeyi, fearing the king's intentions, argues that Bharata will not accept a kingdom devoid of wealth and joy.
6. Dasharatha, in anger, recalls the story of Sagara who exiled his son Asamanja for his misdeeds, questioning what wrong Rama has done to deserve exile.
7. Siddhartha, an elder minister, explains that Asamanja was exiled for his cruelty, unlike Rama who is virtuous and without fault.
8. Siddhartha advises Kaikeyi to reconsider her stance, warning that unjustly exiling Rama would bring dishonor.
9. Dasharatha, overwhelmed with sorrow, declares his intention to renounce the kingdom and follow Rama into exile, leaving Kaikeyi and Bharata to rule.
