## सिद्धार्थप्रतिबोधनम् (siddhArthapratibOdhanam)
**Chapter Title** : Awakening of Siddhartha

King Dasaratha, distressed by his promise, orders a grand procession for Rama's journey. He instructs to prepare a well-equipped army and merchants to accompany Rama. Dasaratha wants Rama to enjoy the forest life without missing the kingdom. Kaikeyi, fearing for her son Bharata, insists on Rama's exile. Dasaratha recalls the story of Sagara's son, Asamanja, who was exiled for his misdeeds. Siddhartha, an elder, questions Kaikeyi's motives, defending Rama's innocence. Dasaratha, heartbroken, decides to follow Rama into exile, leaving the kingdom to Bharata.
