## पौराङ्गनाविलापः (paurAnganAvilApaH)
**Chapter Title** : Lament of the City Women

The people of Ayodhya were deeply saddened by Rama's departure. They returned home with tearful eyes and heavy hearts. The city lost its joy, and businesses came to a halt. Women lamented the absence of Rama, feeling life was meaningless without him. They praised Lakshmana for accompanying Rama and expressed disdain for Kaikeyi. The city became quiet and dark, reflecting the people's sorrow. Ayodhya seemed lifeless, like a sea without water.
