## रामवाक्यम् (rAmavAkyam)
**Chapter Title** : Rama's Speech

The night passed with the grieving brothers and friends. In the morning, Bharata offered the kingdom to Rama, saying it was rightfully his. Rama comforted Bharata, explaining the inevitability of death and the cycle of life. He emphasized the importance of fulfilling one's duties and the futility of mourning. Rama praised their father, King Dasharatha, for his virtuous life and assured Bharata that he would honor their father's wishes by staying in the forest. Rama urged Bharata to return to Ayodhya and rule as their father intended. The brothers shared a moment of understanding and acceptance.
