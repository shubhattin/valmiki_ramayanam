**Chapter Title** : Kausalya's Lamentation

Kausalya laments over King Dasharatha's sorrow and her own grief for Rama's exile. She fears Kaikeyi's happiness and compares her to a freed serpent. Kausalya worries about Rama living in the forest and the hardships he will face. She longs for the day when Rama, Sita, and Lakshmana return to Ayodhya. Kausalya imagines the joyous celebration upon their return. She feels helpless without her son and compares herself to a cow separated from her calf. Kausalya expresses her inability to live without seeing Rama and Lakshmana.
