## पादुकाप्रदानम् (pAdukApradAnam)
**Chapter Title** : Paduka Pradanam

The sages were amazed by the meeting of the two brothers, Rama and Bharata. They praised the brothers for their virtues and wisdom. The sages advised Bharata to follow Rama's words and fulfill his father's wishes. Bharata requested Rama to return and rule the kingdom, but Rama refused. Rama gave his sandals to Bharata as a symbol of authority. Bharata promised to live as an ascetic until Rama's return. Rama instructed Bharata to respect their mother Kaikeyi and sent him back with blessings.
