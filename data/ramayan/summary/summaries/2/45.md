## पौरयाचनम् (paurayAchanam)
**Chapter Title** : Appeal of the Citizens

Rama, loved by the people for his truth and valor, leaves for the forest. Despite King Dasharatha's orders, the citizens follow Rama's chariot. Rama, like a full moon, is dear to the people of Ayodhya. He asks the citizens to show the same love and respect to Bharata. Rama assures them that Bharata will be a good ruler. The citizens, including the elderly and learned, plead with Rama to return. Rama, moved by their pleas, continues on foot with Sita and Lakshmana. The citizens express their devotion and willingness to follow Rama into the forest.
