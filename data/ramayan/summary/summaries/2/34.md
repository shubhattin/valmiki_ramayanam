## दशरथसमाश्वासनम् (dasharathasamAshvAsanam)

**Chapter Title** : Consolation of Dasharatha

1. The chapter begins with Rama, described as having eyes like lotus petals and a complexion like a dark cloud, instructing the charioteer to inform his father, King Dasharatha, of his presence.

2. The charioteer quickly enters the king's chamber and finds Dasharatha in a state of distress, akin to a sun obscured by clouds or a fire covered in ashes.

3. The charioteer respectfully informs the king that Rama, having given away wealth to Brahmins and dependents, is waiting at the door to see him before departing to the great forest.

4. Dasharatha, overwhelmed with sorrow and unable to speak, instructs the charioteer to bring his wives to him so that he can see Rama surrounded by his family.

5. The charioteer conveys the king's message to the women of the palace, who promptly gather and proceed to the king's chamber.

6. Upon their arrival, Dasharatha instructs the charioteer to bring Rama, Lakshmana, and Sita to him.

7. As Rama approaches, Dasharatha, surrounded by his wives, rises from his seat in distress and rushes towards his son, only to faint upon reaching him.

8. Rama, along with Lakshmana, quickly supports the unconscious king, and the palace resounds with the cries of the women lamenting Rama's departure.

9. Once Dasharatha regains consciousness, Rama, with folded hands and tears in his eyes, seeks his father's permission to leave for the forest, asking him to bless Lakshmana and Sita as well.

10. Dasharatha, bound by his promise to Kaikeyi, expresses his helplessness and urges Rama to stay for at least one more night.

11. Rama, steadfast in his resolve, reassures his father of his commitment to fulfill the promise and insists on leaving for the forest immediately.

12. Despite Dasharatha's pleas, Rama remains firm, emphasizing his duty to uphold his father's word and the importance of truth.

13. The chapter concludes with Dasharatha, overwhelmed by grief, embracing Rama and losing consciousness again, while the entire palace is engulfed in sorrow.
