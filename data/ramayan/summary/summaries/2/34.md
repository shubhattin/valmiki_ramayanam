## दशरथसमाश्वासनम् (dasharathasamAshvAsanam)
**Chapter Title** : Consolation of Dasharatha

Rama sends a messenger to inform King Dasharatha of his presence. The king, distressed and weak, is surrounded by his wives. Rama, Lakshmana, and Sita arrive to see the king. Dasharatha faints upon seeing Rama. Rama consoles his father and seeks his blessing to go to the forest. Dasharatha, bound by his promise to Kaikeyi, reluctantly agrees. Rama reassures the king and promises to return after 14 years. The palace is filled with sorrow and lamentation.
