## रामप्रवासनोपायचिन्ता (rAmapravAsanOpAyachintA)
**Chapter Title** : Contemplation on the Means for Rama's Exile

Queen Kaikeyi, influenced by her maid Manthara, decides to send Rama to the forest. She plans to make her son Bharata the king instead. Manthara reminds Kaikeyi of the two boons granted by King Dasharatha. Kaikeyi is advised to use these boons to demand Rama's exile and Bharata's coronation. Kaikeyi agrees and prepares to approach the king. She removes her jewelry and lies on the floor, feigning distress. Manthara assures Kaikeyi that this plan will ensure Bharata's rule and secure her position.
