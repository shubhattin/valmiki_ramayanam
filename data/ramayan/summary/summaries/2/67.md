## अराजकदुरवस्थावर्णनम् (arAjakaduravasthAvarNanam)
**Chapter Title** : Description of the Plight of a Kingdom without a King

The night in Ayodhya was filled with sorrow and tears. At dawn, the royal priests and ministers gathered. They discussed the dire situation after King Dasharatha's death. Rama and Lakshmana were in the forest, and Bharata and Shatrughna were away. The kingdom was without a ruler, causing chaos and lawlessness. The priests urged to appoint a new king to restore order. They suggested crowning Bharata as the new king.
