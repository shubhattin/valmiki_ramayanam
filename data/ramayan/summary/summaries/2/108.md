## जाबालिवाक्यम् (jAbAlivAkyam)

**Chapter Title** : Jabali's Speech

1. The chapter begins with the sage Jabali addressing Rama, who is known for his adherence to dharma (righteousness), as he tries to console Bharata.

2. Jabali questions the futility of Rama's decision to renounce the kingdom, suggesting that such a decision is akin to the thoughts of an ordinary man, not befitting a noble and wise person like Rama.

3. He argues that relationships like those of a father and son are not eternal, as every being is born alone and dies alone.

4. Jabali compares human life to a traveler who stays temporarily in a village and then moves on, implying that attachments to family and possessions are temporary.

5. He advises Rama not to abandon the prosperous kingdom of Ayodhya and endure the hardships of the forest, which is full of difficulties and dangers.

6. Jabali urges Rama to accept the throne of Ayodhya, as the city eagerly awaits his coronation.

7. He emphasizes that Rama should enjoy the royal pleasures and rule Ayodhya like Indra rules the heavens.

8. Jabali dismisses the notion of familial bonds, stating that King Dasharatha is no longer alive and Rama is not bound by any ties to him.

9. He explains that the physical body is merely a combination of elements and that the soul's journey is independent of familial ties.

10. Jabali criticizes those who are overly concerned with religious duties and rituals, as they suffer in this life and face destruction after death.

11. He questions the practice of offering food to the deceased, arguing that it is illogical since the dead cannot consume it.

12. Jabali suggests that one should focus on the present and visible realities rather than unseen and speculative beliefs.

13. He concludes by advising Rama to accept the kingdom, as Bharata has requested, and to prioritize practical wisdom over traditional beliefs.
