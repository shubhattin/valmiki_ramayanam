**Chapter Title** : Jabali's Speech

Jabali, a wise Brahmin, speaks to Rama, advising him against unnecessary renunciation. He questions the concept of familial bonds, suggesting they are temporary. Jabali argues that life is transient, and attachments are like temporary dwellings. He urges Rama to accept the throne of Ayodhya, as his father, King Dasharatha, is no more. Jabali dismisses the idea of afterlife rituals, emphasizing practical living. He encourages Rama to enjoy royal pleasures and rule like Indra in heaven. Jabali's speech challenges traditional beliefs, focusing on present realities.
