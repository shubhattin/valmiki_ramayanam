## गङ्गातरणम् (gangAtaraNam)
**Chapter Title** : Crossing the Ganges

Bharata wakes up early and asks Shatrughna to bring Guha, the Nishada chief, to help them cross the Ganges. Guha arrives and offers his assistance. Bharata requests boats to ferry the army across the river. Guha instructs his people to prepare the boats. Five hundred boats are quickly gathered. Bharata, Shatrughna, and the royal women board the boats. The army and their belongings are ferried across the river. The procession reaches the other side and continues towards the forest of Prayaga.
