## दशरथविलापः (dasharathavilApaH)
**Chapter Title** : Lamentation of Dasharatha

King Dasharatha's horses refused to move as Rama left for the forest. He stayed with Guha, hoping Rama would return. The kingdom appeared desolate, with withered trees and silent forests. People were sorrowful, missing Rama, and the city was joyless. Dasharatha regretted his decision influenced by Kaikeyi. He expressed his desire to see Rama again, feeling he couldn't live without him. Overwhelmed by grief, Dasharatha lamented and fainted, causing fear in Queen Kausalya.
