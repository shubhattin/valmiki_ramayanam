## जानपदाक्रोशः (jAnapadAkrOshaH)
**Chapter Title** : Public Outcry

Rama, remembering his father's command, continued his journey at night. As he traveled, he heard the villagers criticizing King Dasharatha for being under Kaikeyi's influence. They lamented Kaikeyi's harsh actions and worried about Sita's future hardships. The villagers expressed disbelief at King Dasharatha's decision to exile the virtuous Rama. Rama crossed several rivers and regions, showing Sita the lands given to the Ikshvaku dynasty. He expressed a desire to return and enjoy hunting in the Sarayu forest with his family. Rama continued his journey, speaking kindly to his charioteer.
