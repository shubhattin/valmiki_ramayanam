**Chapter Title** : The Lament of the Countrymen

1. As the night passed, Rama, the tiger among men, continued his journey, remembering his father's command.
2. As he traveled, the auspicious night ended, and he performed his morning rituals before entering the boundaries of the kingdom.
3. Rama swiftly passed through villages and blossoming forests, riding on excellent horses like arrows.
4. He heard the voices of the villagers, lamenting King Dasharatha's submission to desire.
5. The villagers criticized the cruel and sinful Kaikeyi, who had broken boundaries and engaged in harsh deeds.
6. They lamented how such a righteous and wise prince like Rama, full of compassion and vigilance, was sent to exile.
7. They wondered how the fortunate Sita, daughter of Janaka, accustomed to comfort, would endure hardships.
8. They expressed disbelief at King Dasharatha's lack of affection for his beloved son, Rama, who was innocent and cherished by the people.
9. Hearing these words, the heroic Rama, the lord of Kosala, continued his journey.
10. He crossed the river Vedashruti, which carried sacred waters, and proceeded towards the direction inhabited by Agastya.
11. After traveling for a long time, he crossed the cool waters of the Gomati river, which flowed towards the ocean.
12. Crossing the Gomati with swift horses, he reached the river Syandika, filled with the sounds of peacocks and swans.
13. Rama showed Sita the prosperous land given to the Ikshvaku by Manu, filled with thriving communities.
14. Addressing his charioteer Sumantra, Rama, the illustrious bull among men, expressed his longing.
15. He yearned to return to the blossoming forests of the Sarayu river, to engage in hunting with his mother and father.
16. He expressed his desire for the unparalleled joy of hunting, esteemed by royal sages.
17. In this world, hunting is a pleasure for royal sages, performed at the right time and desired by archers.
18. Thus, the Ikshvaku prince, speaking sweetly to his charioteer, continued his journey, expressing his thoughts.
