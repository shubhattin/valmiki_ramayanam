## भरतदुःस्वप्नः (bharataduHsvapnaH)
**Chapter Title** : Bharata's Bad Dream

Bharata had a disturbing dream the night messengers arrived in the city. He saw his father, King Dasaratha, in distress, falling from a mountain into a muddy lake. In the dream, Dasaratha was drinking oil and laughing strangely. Bharata also saw a dry ocean, a fallen moon, and a broken elephant tusk. He witnessed the earth cracking and trees drying up. Bharata saw women laughing at the king, who was dressed in black. A demoness in red was dragging the king southwards. Bharata feared that either Rama, King Dasaratha, or Lakshmana would die soon.
