## भरतदुःस्वप्नः (bharataduHsvapnaH)

**Chapter Title** : Bharata's Ominous Dream

1. The messengers entered the city on the same night when Bharata experienced an ominous dream.
2. Upon waking, Bharata, the son of the great king, was deeply troubled by the dream he had seen.
3. His friends, who were well-wishers and spoke kindly, tried to alleviate his distress by engaging in conversations in the assembly.
4. Some played soothing music, others performed dances, and some narrated various comedies and plays.
5. Despite the efforts of his friends, who were trying to entertain him with jokes and laughter, Bharata, the noble son of Raghu, was not pleased.
6. One of his dear friends, surrounded by other companions, asked Bharata why he was not enjoying the entertainment.
7. Bharata explained to his friend the reason for his distress, which was the ominous dream he had experienced.
8. In the dream, he saw his father, disheveled and falling from a mountain peak into a muddy lake.
9. He also saw his father floating in the lake, drinking oil with his hands, and laughing repeatedly.
10. After consuming sesame rice, his father, with his body smeared with oil, submerged himself in oil again.
11. Bharata also saw the ocean dried up, the moon fallen to the earth, and the sacred fire extinguished suddenly.
12. The tusk of the royal elephant was shattered, and the sacred fire was extinguished suddenly.
13. He witnessed the earth split open, various trees dried up, and mountains covered with smoke.
14. Bharata saw his father seated on an iron seat, wearing black garments, and being mocked by women with dark and yellowish complexions.
15. In a hurry, a virtuous man adorned with red garlands and unguents was seen traveling southward in a chariot drawn by donkeys.
16. Bharata saw a demoness with a distorted face, dressed in red, dragging the king away while laughing.
17. Bharata expressed his fear that either he, Rama, the king, or Lakshmana would die soon.
18. He mentioned that a person who travels in a dream in a vehicle drawn by donkeys soon sees the smoke of his funeral pyre.
19. Bharata felt distressed and could not honor his friends, as his throat was dry and his mind was not at ease.
20. He could not identify the source of his fear, but he felt that his voice was lost, and his shadow was diminished.
21. Bharata felt disgusted with himself without knowing the reason, and the ominous dream left him with great fear in his heart, pondering over the king's unexpected appearance.
