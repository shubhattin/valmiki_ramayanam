**Chapter Title** : Return of the Citizens

The citizens of Ayodhya wake up feeling lost without Rama. They are overwhelmed with grief and cannot see any hope. They express their sorrow and question how Rama, who always protected them, could leave. They feel life is meaningless without him. Some suggest ending their lives by fire. They wonder how to face the city without Rama. They return to Ayodhya, feeling defeated and heartbroken. The city seems lifeless and joyless without Rama.
