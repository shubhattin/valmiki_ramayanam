**Chapter Title** : The Return of the Citizens

1. As dawn broke, the citizens of Ayodhya were overcome with grief and inactivity, feeling lost without Rama.
2. They wandered aimlessly, unable to catch a glimpse of Rama, their hearts heavy with sorrow.
3. The wise among them, with faces marked by despair, spoke words of lamentation.
4. They cursed the sleep that had dulled their senses, preventing them from seeing Rama, the broad-chested and mighty-armed.
5. They wondered how Rama, the great warrior, who never failed in his duties, could abandon his devoted people and go into exile.
6. They lamented how the best of the Raghu dynasty, who protected them like a father, had left them for the forest.
7. They questioned the purpose of living without Rama, contemplating death or a great journey instead.
8. They considered building a funeral pyre with the abundant dry wood and entering it together.
9. They were at a loss for words to explain to the mighty and gentle-spoken Rama why they had not accompanied him.
10. They foresaw the city of Ayodhya becoming desolate and joyless without Rama, filled with women, children, and the elderly.
11. They wondered how they could return to the city, having left with the great soul and now bereft of him.
12. Raising their arms, they lamented like cows bereft of their calves, overwhelmed by sorrow.
13. Following the path, they traveled for a while but were soon lost and overcome by great despair.
14. They turned back, questioning their fate and what they should do, feeling abandoned by destiny.
15. Weary and distressed, they returned to Ayodhya, a city now filled with sorrow and anxiety.
16. Seeing the city, their hearts were troubled, and tears flowed from their eyes, burdened by grief.
17. The city, without Rama, appeared dull, like a river without its serpent or the sky without the moon.
18. They saw the city, devoid of joy, like an ocean without water, and were struck by its desolation.
19. Entering their grand homes, they were overwhelmed by sorrow, unable to greet their family or others, their joy vanished.
