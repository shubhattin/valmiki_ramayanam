**Chapter Title** : The Example of Dasharatha

King Dasharatha recounts a tragic incident from his past to Kausalya. He accidentally killed a young ascetic while hunting, mistaking him for an elephant. The ascetic's parents, who were blind, cursed Dasharatha to die of grief from losing his son. Dasharatha is now reminded of this curse as he mourns Rama's exile. He expresses deep sorrow and regret, feeling the weight of his past actions. Overcome by grief, Dasharatha dies, fulfilling the curse. The chapter highlights themes of fate, regret, and the consequences of one's actions.
