## सभास्थानम् (sabhAsthAnam)
**Chapter Title** : Assembly Hall

Bharata was awakened by the sound of bards singing praises. The loud music reminded him of his sorrow. Bharata expressed his grief to Shatrughna, lamenting the actions of Kaikeyi. He felt the kingdom was like a rudderless ship. The women in the palace cried seeing Bharata's distress. Sage Vasishta entered the assembly hall to address the situation. He instructed messengers to gather important people for a meeting.
