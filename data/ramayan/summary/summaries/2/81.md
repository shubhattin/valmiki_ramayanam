## सभास्थानम् (sabhAsthAnam)

**Chapter Title** : Assembly Hall

1. The chapter begins with the bards and minstrels singing auspicious praises to Bharata during the early hours of the morning.
2. The sound of drums and conch shells fills the air, creating a grand and overwhelming atmosphere.
3. The loud music further deepens Bharata's sorrow, as he is already grieving.
4. Upon awakening, Bharata, distressed, tells Shatrughna that he is not the king and laments the great harm done by Kaikeyi to the world.
5. Bharata mourns the departure of King Dasharatha, who left behind sorrow and the kingdom's prosperity, which now seems adrift like a rudderless boat.
6. He reflects on how Rama, their great protector, was exiled to the forest by his own mother, Kaikeyi, abandoning dharma.
7. Seeing Bharata's lamentation, the women around him also begin to weep.
8. Meanwhile, the illustrious sage Vasistha, knowledgeable in royal duties, enters the assembly hall of the Ikshvaku dynasty.
9. The assembly hall is described as beautiful, adorned with precious stones, resembling the divine Sudharma hall.
10. Vasistha, well-versed in all Vedas, takes his seat on a golden throne and instructs the messengers.
11. He orders the immediate gathering of Brahmins, Kshatriyas, warriors, ministers, and other important people, as urgent matters need to be addressed.
12. Vasistha also calls for Shatrughna, the illustrious Bharata, Yudhajit, Sumantra, and other well-wishers.
13. A great commotion arises as people arrive in chariots, on horses, and elephants.
14. As Bharata enters, he is welcomed by the citizens with the same reverence they showed to King Dasharatha.
15. The assembly hall, filled with people and adorned with jewels, resembles a serene lake with its still waters and beautiful aquatic life, reminiscent of the times of King Dasharatha.
