**Chapter Title** : Meeting with Mothers

1. Sage Vasistha, along with the wives of King Dasharatha, proceeds to the place where they are eager to see Rama.
2. The royal women, on their way to the Mandakini River, observe the sacred spot frequented by Rama and Lakshmana.
3. Queen Kausalya, with a face full of tears, speaks to Sumitra and the other royal women about the hardships faced by their sons in the forest.
4. Kausalya laments the condition of her son Rama, who, despite his noble deeds, is living a life of hardship in the forest.
5. She expresses her sorrow over the simple food offerings made by Rama to his father, King Dasharatha, and questions how a king who once enjoyed all luxuries could now partake in such humble meals.
6. The queens, after consoling Kausalya, proceed to the hermitage and see Rama, who appears like a celestial being fallen from heaven.
7. Overcome with emotion, the mothers shed tears upon seeing Rama, who has renounced all royal comforts.
8. Rama, the noble prince, rises and respectfully touches the feet of all his mothers.
9. The mothers, with their gentle hands, wipe the dust off Rama's back, showing their affection.
10. Lakshmana, following Rama, also pays his respects to the mothers, who treat him with the same affection as they do Rama.
11. Sita, with tearful eyes, bows to her mothers-in-law and stands before them, distressed.
12. Kausalya embraces Sita, who is emaciated and sorrowful due to her forest life, and speaks to her with compassion.
13. Kausalya questions how Sita, the daughter of King Janaka and wife of Rama, has come to endure such suffering in the desolate forest.
14. Kausalya compares Sita's face, affected by hardships, to a lotus scorched by the sun or a moon obscured by clouds.
15. As Kausalya speaks in distress, Rama approaches and respectfully touches the feet of Sage Vasistha, akin to Indra honoring Brihaspati.
16. Rama, with great respect, sits beside Vasistha, who is like a blazing fire in his brilliance.
17. Bharata, accompanied by ministers and soldiers, sits near Rama, observing him in his ascetic attire.
18. Bharata, with folded hands, looks at Rama, shining with splendor, much like Indra revering Prajapati.
19. The noble assembly wonders what Bharata will say to Rama after paying his respects.
20. Rama, steadfast in truth, along with the virtuous Lakshmana and righteous Bharata, shines in the assembly like the three sacred fires surrounded by priests.
