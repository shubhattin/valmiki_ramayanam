**Chapter Title** : Mother's Meeting

Vasistha led the queens of King Dasharatha to meet Rama. The queens saw the place where Rama and Lakshmana had been. Kausalya, filled with tears, spoke to Sumitra and other queens about their sons' hardships. She lamented seeing the simple food Rama offered to his father. The queens comforted each other and went to see Rama. They cried upon seeing Rama living simply. Rama and Lakshmana respectfully greeted their mothers. Sita also greeted the queens, and Kausalya comforted her. Rama then greeted Vasistha, and they all sat together. Everyone was curious about what Bharata would say to Rama.
