## रामप्रतिज्ञा (rAmapratijnA)
**Chapter Title** : Rama's Promise

Rama hears the harsh words of Kaikeyi but remains calm. He agrees to go to the forest, wearing ascetic clothes, to honor his father's promise. Rama wonders why King Dasharatha did not tell him directly about Bharata's coronation. He assures Kaikeyi that he will fulfill his father's wishes without anger. Rama expresses his willingness to give up the kingdom for Bharata even without being asked. Kaikeyi is pleased and urges Rama to leave quickly. Rama prepares to depart, saying goodbye to his family and friends, while Lakshmana follows him loyally.
