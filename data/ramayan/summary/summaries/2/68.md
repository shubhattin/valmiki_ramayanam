## दूतप्रेषणम् (dUtaprEShaNam)
**Chapter Title** : Sending of Messengers

Vasistha instructs the ministers and Brahmins to send messengers to bring Bharata and Shatrughna back. The messengers are to travel quickly with swift horses. They are told not to inform Bharata about Rama's exile or King Dasharatha's death. The messengers are given fine clothes and ornaments for Bharata. They set out on their journey, crossing rivers and regions swiftly. They travel through various lands, observing rivers and wildlife. The messengers reach their destination at night, eager to fulfill their mission.
