## कौसल्यासमाश्वसनम् (kausalyAsamAshvasanam)

**Chapter Title** : Consolation of Kausalya

1. Kausalya, overwhelmed with grief and trembling, expresses her inability to live without Rama, Sita, and Lakshmana, and requests the charioteer to take her to the forest where they are.
2. She declares that if she cannot follow them, she would rather go to the abode of Yama (death).
3. The charioteer, with folded hands, consoles Kausalya, urging her to abandon sorrow and delusion, assuring her that Rama will live righteously in the forest.
4. Lakshmana, devoted to serving Rama's feet, will also live in the forest, mastering his senses and fulfilling his dharma.
5. Sita, though in the forest, feels as secure as she did at home, her mind completely entrusted to Rama.
6. The charioteer observes no sign of distress in Sita, who seems accustomed to exile, and she enjoys the forest as she once did the gardens of the city.
7. Sita, with a face like the full moon, remains cheerful and untroubled, her heart and life entirely devoted to Rama.
8. The charioteer describes Sita's face as radiant and unblemished, unaffected by the journey's hardships.
9. Sita's feet, compared to lotus buds, remain unblemished, and she moves gracefully, adorned with her ornaments.
10. Even when encountering wild animals, Sita remains fearless, protected by Rama's presence.
11. The charioteer reassures Kausalya that neither she nor her son nor the king should be grieved, as their actions will be eternally renowned.
12. Despite the charioteer's consoling words, Kausalya, distressed by her son's absence, continues to lament, calling out to Rama, her beloved son.
