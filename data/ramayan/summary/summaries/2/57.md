## सुमन्त्रोपावर्तनम् (sumantrOpAvartanam)
**Chapter Title** : Sumantra's Return

Sumantra, deeply saddened, leaves Rama and returns home. He travels through fragrant forests and rivers, reaching Ayodhya on the third day. The city appears silent and joyless, causing Sumantra to worry. People ask him about Rama, and he tells them he left Rama at the Ganges. The citizens, filled with sorrow, lament Rama's absence. Sumantra reaches King Dasharatha's palace and finds the king in deep grief. Queen Kausalya, overwhelmed with sorrow, faints. The palace is filled with cries of lamentation.
