**Chapter Title** : Sumantra's Return

1. Guha, after a sorrowful conversation with Sumantra, returns to his home as Rama stays on the southern bank.
2. Sumantra, having been permitted, harnesses the best horses and sets out for Ayodhya, deeply troubled.
3. He travels swiftly through fragrant forests, rivers, lakes, villages, and towns.
4. On the third day, at evening, he reaches Ayodhya, finding it joyless and silent.
5. Sumantra, struck by grief, wonders if the city, with its elephants, horses, people, and leaders, has been consumed by the fire of sorrow due to Rama's departure.
6. As he enters the city gate quickly, people gather around him, asking about Rama's whereabouts.
7. Sumantra informs them that he has taken leave of Rama at the Ganges and returned, as permitted by the virtuous Rama.
8. The people, realizing Rama has crossed the river, are filled with tears and lament, expressing their despair at not seeing Rama again.
9. They recall Rama's righteous rule, likening him to a father, and lament the loss of his presence in their lives.
10. Sumantra hears the lamentations of women, grieving for Rama, as he passes through the city.
11. He proceeds to King Dasharatha's palace, covering his face, and enters the royal chambers.
12. The women in the palace, distressed by Rama's absence, cry out in sorrow.
13. Sumantra, witnessing the king's wives lamenting, enters the eighth chamber and finds King Dasharatha pale and grief-stricken.
14. Sumantra conveys Rama's message to the king, who, overwhelmed by sorrow, faints.
15. The inner palace is thrown into turmoil as the king falls unconscious, and the women raise their arms in despair.
16. Kausalya, with Sumitra, lifts the fallen king and speaks to him, urging him to respond to Sumantra, the messenger of the noble Rama.
17. She implores the king to rise, reminding him that lamentation offers no help, and assures him that Kaikeyi is not present to cause fear.
18. Kausalya, overcome with grief, falls to the ground, her speech choked with tears.
19. Seeing Kausalya's lamentation and the king's condition, all the women cry out in sorrow.
20. The entire city is filled with the sound of lamentation, as both the elderly and the young, along with all the women, mourn, making the city tumultuous once again.
