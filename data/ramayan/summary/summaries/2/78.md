**Chapter Title** : The Humiliation of Manthara

1. Shatrughna, the younger brother of Lakshmana, addresses Bharata, who is distressed by grief, questioning why the virtuous and powerful Rama was exiled to the forest by a woman.
2. Shatrughna expresses his frustration that even the mighty Lakshmana did not prevent Rama's exile, despite the king being under the influence of a woman.
3. As Shatrughna speaks, Manthara, adorned with jewelry and fine clothes, appears at the palace gate.
4. The gatekeeper, recognizing Manthara as the cause of Rama's exile and King Dasharatha's death, presents her to Shatrughna.
5. Shatrughna, filled with anger and grief, orders the attendants to bring Manthara to him.
6. Manthara, surrounded by her companions, is forcibly brought to Shatrughna, who drags her across the ground in his rage.
7. As Manthara is dragged, her ornaments scatter across the palace floor, creating a scene of chaos.
8. Shatrughna, in his fury, confronts Kaikeyi with harsh words, blaming her for the suffering caused to his family.
9. Kaikeyi, distressed by Shatrughna's anger, seeks refuge with her son Bharata.
10. Bharata intervenes, calming Shatrughna by reminding him that women are not to be harmed and should be forgiven.
11. Bharata expresses his own anger towards Kaikeyi but refrains from violence, fearing Rama's disapproval.
12. Shatrughna, heeding Bharata's words, releases Manthara, who falls at Kaikeyi's feet, lamenting her fate.
13. Kaikeyi, observing Manthara's distress, gently comforts her, despite the chaos caused by her actions.
