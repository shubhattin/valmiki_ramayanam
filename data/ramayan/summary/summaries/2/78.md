## कुब्जाविक्षेपः (kubjAvikShEpaH)
**Chapter Title** : Kubja's Reprimand

Shatrughna, Lakshmana's younger brother, speaks to a grief-stricken Bharata about Rama's exile. He questions why Lakshmana didn't stop Rama's exile. Shatrughna encounters Manthara, the cause of Rama's exile, and captures her. Manthara's friends flee in fear of Shatrughna's anger. Shatrughna drags Manthara, scattering her ornaments. Bharata intervenes, reminding Shatrughna that women should not be harmed. Shatrughna releases Manthara, who falls at Kaikeyi's feet, lamenting her fate.
