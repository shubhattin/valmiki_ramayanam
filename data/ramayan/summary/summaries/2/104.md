## रामभरतसंवादः (rAmabharatasaMvAdaH)
**Chapter Title** : Rama and Bharata's Conversation

Rama meets his brother Bharata, who is dressed in ascetic attire. Bharata explains that their father, King Dasharatha, has died due to grief. He tells Rama that their mother, Kaikeyi, has caused this by demanding the throne for Bharata. Bharata pleads with Rama to return and rule Ayodhya. Rama, however, insists on fulfilling his father's wishes and staying in the forest. He reassures Bharata that he holds no grudge against him or their mother. Rama emphasizes the importance of duty and promises to return after his exile.
