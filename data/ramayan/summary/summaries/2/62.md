## कौसल्याप्रसादनम् (kausalyAprasAdanam)

**Chapter Title** : Kausalya's Appeasement

1. King Dasharatha, deeply troubled and sorrowful, is confronted by Kausalya, who is angry and grieving over Rama's exile.
2. Overwhelmed by his emotions, the king loses consciousness but regains it after some time, only to be reminded of his past misdeeds.
3. The king, tormented by the dual grief of his actions and Rama's exile, seeks forgiveness from Kausalya, acknowledging her compassion and righteousness.
4. Kausalya, despite her own sorrow, is moved by the king's plea and expresses her understanding of dharma, recognizing the king's virtues.
5. She acknowledges the destructive power of grief, which can overshadow wisdom and courage, and compares her suffering to the vastness of the ocean.
6. As Kausalya speaks, the day turns to night, and King Dasharatha, comforted by her words, succumbs to sleep, still burdened by sorrow.
