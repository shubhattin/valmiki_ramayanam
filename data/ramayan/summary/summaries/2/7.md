**Chapter Title** : Lamentation of Manthara

1. Manthara, a maidservant of Queen Kaikeyi, ascends a palace terrace and observes the city of Ayodhya, which is beautifully decorated and filled with joyous people.
2. She notices the city adorned with flags, banners, and fragrant water, and hears the sounds of music and celebration.
3. Curious about the festivities, Manthara inquires from a nearby nurse about the reason for the city's joy.
4. The nurse informs Manthara that King Dasharatha is planning to anoint Rama as the crown prince the next day.
5. Hearing this, Manthara, filled with anger and jealousy, descends from the terrace and approaches Queen Kaikeyi.
6. Manthara warns Kaikeyi of the impending danger to her and her son Bharata, as Rama's coronation would diminish their status.
7. She manipulates Kaikeyi by highlighting the potential loss of power and influence, urging her to act swiftly to prevent Rama's coronation.
8. Initially, Kaikeyi is pleased with the news of Rama's coronation, but Manthara's words sow seeds of doubt and fear in her mind.
9. Manthara's cunning words convince Kaikeyi to take action to secure her son's future and her own position in the royal family.
