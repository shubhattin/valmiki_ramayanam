## भरतगुणप्रशंसा (bharataguNaprashaMsA)

**Chapter Title** : Praise of Bharata's Virtues

1. Rama calms the enraged Lakshmana, who is overcome with anger, and questions the need for weapons when Bharata himself has come.
2. Rama emphasizes the futility of fighting Bharata, who has come to fulfill their father's promise, and questions the value of a kingdom gained through fratricide.
3. Rama expresses his unwillingness to accept anything that would harm his relatives or friends, comparing it to consuming poison.
4. He declares his desire for Dharma, Artha, Kama, and the earth itself for the sake of his brothers, and swears by truth.
5. Rama states that he does not desire the earth, even if it is difficult to obtain, through unrighteous means, not even for the position of Indra.
6. He expresses that any happiness without Bharata, Lakshmana, and Shatrughna would be like ashes.
7. Rama believes Bharata, who is dearer to him than life, has come to see him out of brotherly love and adherence to family duty.
8. He suggests that Bharata, upon hearing of Rama's exile and ascetic attire, has come with a heart full of affection and a mind disturbed by grief.
9. Rama speculates that Bharata has come to persuade their father and to offer the kingdom to Rama.
10. He assures Lakshmana that Bharata would not act against them even in thought.
11. Rama questions if Bharata has ever done anything unpleasant to Lakshmana or if there is any fear of Bharata now.
12. He insists that Bharata should not be spoken to harshly or unpleasantly, as Rama himself would be hurt by such actions.
13. Rama questions how sons could harm their father or brothers harm each other for the sake of a kingdom.
14. He promises to speak to Bharata and offer him the kingdom if that is Lakshmana's concern.
15. Rama is confident that Bharata, even if told to take the kingdom, would agree without hesitation.
16. Lakshmana, feeling ashamed, enters his own body, metaphorically, after being addressed by his righteous brother.
17. Lakshmana, embarrassed, suggests that perhaps their father, King Dasaratha, has come to see them.
18. Rama, observing Lakshmana's embarrassment, reassures him that Bharata has likely come to see them.
19. Rama speculates that Bharata might have come to take them back to the comforts of home after considering their forest exile.
20. He also considers that Bharata might take Sita, who is accustomed to great comfort, back to Ayodhya.
21. Rama observes the two swift and beautiful horses, resembling the wind in speed, approaching.
22. He notes the presence of the great elephant, Shatrunjaya, at the head of the army, belonging to their wise father.
23. Rama expresses doubt as he does not see the white royal umbrella, a symbol of their father's presence.
24. Lakshmana descends from the Sala tree and stands beside Rama with folded hands.
25. Bharata, having instructed that there should be no commotion, arranges the army's encampment around the mountain.
26. The army, led by the righteous Bharata, devoid of arrogance, and for the purpose of appeasing Rama, encamps gracefully at Chitrakuta.
