**Chapter Title** : The Wrath of Vasistha Due to the Acceptance of Bark Garments

Rama humbly refuses the royal escort for his forest exile. He requests simple bark garments instead. Kaikeyi brings the garments, and Rama, Lakshmana, and Sita wear them. Sita hesitates but eventually dons the attire. Vasistha, the royal priest, is angered by Kaikeyi's actions. He argues that Sita should not wear ascetic clothes. Vasistha insists Sita should live in the forest with dignity.
