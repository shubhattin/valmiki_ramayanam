**Chapter Title** : Conciliation of Kaikeyi

1. Queen Kaikeyi, influenced by the wicked words of her maid Manthara, lay on the ground like a celestial nymph struck down.
2. After contemplating her course of action, Kaikeyi, under the spell of Manthara's words, sighed deeply and decided on a plan that would bring her happiness.
3. Manthara, pleased with Kaikeyi's decision, felt as if she had achieved her goal.
4. Kaikeyi, filled with anger, discarded her ornaments and lay on the ground, appearing like a celestial nymph deprived of her splendor.
5. King Dasharatha, having ordered the coronation of Rama, entered the inner chambers to inform his beloved queen, Kaikeyi, of the joyous news.
6. Upon entering Kaikeyi's splendid abode, which was adorned with beautiful decorations and filled with the sounds of music, the king did not find her in her usual place.
7. The king, eager to share the happy news, was distressed upon not finding Kaikeyi and inquired about her whereabouts.
8. The maid informed the king that Kaikeyi was extremely angry and had gone to the chamber of wrath.
9. Disturbed by this news, King Dasharatha, with a heavy heart, went to the chamber and found Kaikeyi lying on the ground, appearing as if she had been wronged.
10. The king, deeply concerned, gently asked Kaikeyi the reason for her anger and assured her that he would fulfill any of her desires.
11. He promised to grant her any wish, even if it meant sacrificing his own life, and urged her to speak her mind without fear.
12. Kaikeyi, reassured by the king's words, prepared to speak her unpleasant demand, intending to press her advantage further.
