**Chapter Title** : The Supremacy of Fate

Rama approaches his brother Lakshmana, who is upset and angry. He calms Lakshmana, asking him to stop the preparations for his coronation. Rama decides to go to the forest to fulfill his father's promise to Kaikeyi. He expresses no resentment towards his stepmother Kaikeyi, understanding it as fate's doing. Rama reassures Lakshmana that the change in plans is due to destiny, not anyone's fault. He emphasizes the power of fate over human actions. Rama remains composed and instructs Lakshmana to prepare for his departure to the forest.
