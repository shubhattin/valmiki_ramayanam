## पितृदिष्टान्तश्रवणम् (pitRdiShTAntashravaNam)
**Chapter Title** : Hearing of the Father's Demise

Bharata responds to Rama's words, questioning the value of royal duties without righteousness. He insists that the eldest son should rule, urging Rama to return to Ayodhya and be crowned. Bharata believes a king is divine when he acts righteously. He informs Rama of their father's death after Rama left for the forest. Bharata urges Rama to perform the water rites for their father. Bharata and Shatrughna have already performed the rites. Their father died longing to see Rama, filled with grief.
