## पौरवाक्यम् (pauravAkyam)
**Chapter Title** : The Words of the Citizens

Rama and Sita, along with Lakshmana, give away wealth to Brahmins and proceed to meet King Dasharatha. The citizens, seeing them on foot, express their sorrow and disbelief. They recall Rama's past glory and express their sadness over his exile. The people admire Rama's virtues and lament the kingdom's loss. They express a desire to follow Rama into the forest, abandoning their homes. The citizens criticize Kaikeyi and wish to live peacefully with Rama in the forest. Despite hearing these words, Rama remains composed and continues to his father's palace.
