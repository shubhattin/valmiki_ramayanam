**Chapter Title** : Rama's Reunion

Bharata, eager to meet his brother Rama, sets out with Shatrughna. He instructs Sage Vasishta to bring their mothers quickly. As they travel, they see signs of Rama's presence in the forest. Bharata is filled with emotion upon seeing Rama's simple dwelling. He laments Rama's hardships and blames himself for Rama's exile. Overcome with grief, Bharata falls at Rama's feet, unable to speak. Shatrughna also weeps and bows to Rama. Rama embraces them both, and they are joined by Sumantra and Guha. The forest dwellers witness this emotional reunion.
