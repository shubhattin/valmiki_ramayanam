## जनाक्रोशः (janAkrOshaH)

**Chapter Title** : Public Lamentation

1. The people of Ayodhya express their sorrow and anger towards King Dasharatha for allowing Sita, who is accustomed to comfort, to wear ascetic garments and accompany Rama to the forest.
2. King Dasharatha, deeply pained by the public outcry, loses faith in his own righteousness and reputation.
3. He laments to Kaikeyi that Sita, being delicate and young, is not suited for the hardships of forest life.
4. Dasharatha reflects on the inappropriateness of Sita, a princess, standing in ascetic attire among the people, appearing like a distressed ascetic woman.
5. He regrets the harsh vow he made, influenced by Kaikeyi's demands, and wishes for Sita to go to the forest comfortably with all her jewels.
6. Dasharatha questions Kaikeyi's motives, wondering what wrong Sita or Rama have done to deserve such treatment.
7. He acknowledges that exiling Rama was already a severe punishment and questions the need for further cruelty.
8. Rama, preparing to leave for the forest, speaks to his father, urging him to care for his mother Kausalya, who is virtuous and does not blame Dasharatha.
9. Rama requests Dasharatha to support Kausalya, who will be overwhelmed by grief in his absence, ensuring she does not succumb to sorrow.
10. Rama emphasizes the importance of honoring Kausalya, so she does not perish from grief while he is in the forest.
