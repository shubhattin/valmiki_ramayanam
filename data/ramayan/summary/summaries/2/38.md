## जनाक्रोशः (janAkrOshaH)
**Chapter Title** : Public Outcry

The people of Ayodhya lament as Sita dons forest attire, feeling abandoned. King Dasharatha is deeply saddened by the public's cries and loses faith in his righteousness. He questions Kaikeyi's demand for Sita to wear ascetic clothes, as Sita is delicate and accustomed to comfort. Dasharatha regrets his harsh promise to Kaikeyi, which he made without considering its consequences. He questions Kaikeyi's motives, as Sita has done no harm. Rama, preparing to leave for the forest, speaks to his father, urging him to care for his mother Kausalya. Rama worries about Kausalya's grief and asks Dasharatha to ensure she doesn't succumb to sorrow.
