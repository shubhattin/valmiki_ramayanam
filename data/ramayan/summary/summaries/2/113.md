**Chapter Title** : Taking of the Sandals

Bharata placed the sandals on his head and got on the chariot with Shatrughna. Vasishta, Vamadeva, and other ministers led the way. They traveled eastward, admiring the beautiful Mandakini River and Chitrakuta mountain. Bharata visited sage Bharadwaja's ashram and paid respects. Bharadwaja asked if Bharata met Rama. Bharata explained Rama's decision to honor their father's promise. Bharata took the sandals as a symbol of Rama's rule and returned to Ayodhya, feeling sorrowful seeing the city without his father and brother.
