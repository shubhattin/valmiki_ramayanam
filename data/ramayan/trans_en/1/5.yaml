8: >
  The city was adorned with large, well-organized streets and royal highways, always sprinkled with water and covered with flowers.

  King Dasharatha, who expanded his kingdom and was a great monarch, lived in this city, as the king of gods, Indra, resided in heaven.

  It was surrounded by tributary kings who paid homage and was adorned with merchants from various regions who added to its beauty.

  The city was embellished with palaces made of jewels, resembling mountains, and was filled with multi-storied mansions, much like the city of Indra, Amaravati.

  It was intricately designed in the shape of an eight-petaled lotus and filled with beautiful women. It was adorned with all types of gems and shining with splendid homes and palaces.

  The city resounded with the sounds of drums, mridangas, veenas, and panavas (a type of drum), creating a delightful and intense melody, making it unparalleled on earth.

19: >
  It was like a celestial city attained by the Siddhas through austerities in heaven, with well-arranged homes and populated by the best of men.

20: >
  There were warriors who could hit invisible targets with their arrows and skilled archers who could strike based on sound alone. They were quick-handed and highly proficient.

21: >
  The forests resounded with the roars of lions, tigers, and boars. These mighty warriors, with sharp weapons and powerful arms, hunted them.

22: >
  King Dasharatha filled this city with thousands of such great warriors and charioteers, making it truly a magnificent city.

23: >
  The city was filled with learned brahmins who were skilled in the six branches of Vedic knowledge. They were generous, truthful, and as great as sages, performing rituals with excellence.
