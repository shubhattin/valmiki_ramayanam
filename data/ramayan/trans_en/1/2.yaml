  And now, the 2nd chapter in the Childhood Section
  of Valmiki Ramayanam, named 'Brahma's Arrival'.

1: >
  After hearing those words of Narada, Valmiki, the virtuous and wise sage, along with his disciples, honored the great sage with reverence.

2: >
  Having been duly honored by Valmiki, the divine sage Narada, after taking leave, ascended to the heavens.

3: >
  Once Narada had left for the celestial world, the sage Valmiki proceeded to the banks of the Tamasa River, not far from the Ganga.

4: >
  Reaching the riverbank, the sage Valmiki, seeing the clear and untainted waters, spoke to his disciple standing nearby.

5: >
  "Look, Bharadwaja, this is a beautiful, clear waterway, free of mud. It is as pleasing to the mind as the hearts of virtuous men."

6: >
  "Place the water pot down, and bring my bark garments. I shall bathe in this excellent Tamasa river."

7: >
  Thus commanded by the great sage Valmiki, Bharadwaja, ever obedient, handed his teacher the bark garments.

8: >
  The sage, with controlled senses, took the bark garments from his disciple and wandered, observing the expansive forest.

9: >
  Nearby, the sage saw a pair of Krauncha birds (a type of heron), calling sweetly as they roamed together.

10: >
  But then, a hunter, full of wickedness, struck one of the pair, the male bird, right before the sage's eyes.

11: >
  The bird, its body drenched in blood, writhed on the ground. Seeing her mate killed, the female bird cried out pitifully.

12: >
  Deprived of her companion, the bird, who had always moved with her mate, now mourned, her cries filled with anguish.

13: >
  Seeing the bird killed so cruelly by the hunter, compassion arose in the heart of the righteous sage.

14: >
  Moved by this sorrow, the sage declared, "This is an act of adharma," as he observed the weeping Krauncha bird.

15: >
  "O hunter, may you never find peace for all eternity, for you have killed one of the Krauncha pair, who were together and filled with love."

16: >
  As he spoke these words, a thought arose in the sage's mind, wondering, "What is this that I have just uttered, born out of my sorrow?"

17: >
  Pondering further, the wise sage, who was highly intelligent, reflected on the words he had spoken and then addressed his disciple.

18: >
  "These words that have arisen from my grief are set in meter, bound in four-footed verse, and united with melody. Let this utterance be a 'shloka' (verse)."

19: >
  The sage's disciple, delighted, accepted the master's words with great joy, and the sage was pleased with him.

20: >
  After completing his ablutions in the holy river according to tradition, the sage, contemplating the event, returned to his hermitage.

21: >
  The well-disciplined disciple Bharadwaja, who had listened attentively to his teacher, took the filled water pot and followed him.

22: >
  The virtuous sage entered his hermitage with his disciple, sat down, and, after narrating other stories, entered into meditation.

23: >
  At that moment, Brahma, the creator of the world and the four-faced god of immense brilliance, arrived to meet the great sage Valmiki.

24: >
  Upon seeing Brahma, Valmiki immediately rose, controlling his speech, and stood in awe, palms joined, filled with deep reverence.

25: >
  Valmiki worshiped the god with water for washing his feet, offerings, and praises. He bowed reverently and inquired about the god’s well-being.

26: >
  Brahma, after taking a seat on a highly honored seat, invited Valmiki to sit as well.

27: >
  Valmiki, permitted by Brahma, sat down on his seat, while the creator, Brahma, who is the father of the worlds, was present.

28: >
  Valmiki, with his mind focused on the event, meditated on the cruelty of the hunter who had killed the innocent Krauncha bird.

29: >
  Grieving for the sorrowful Krauncha, Valmiki, in his sadness, again composed a verse, lamenting the needless killing of the bird.

30: >
  Lost in his thoughts and filled with sorrow, the sage was then addressed by Brahma, who smiled and spoke to him.

31: >
  "O sage, let this verse you have composed remain as a 'shloka.' There is no need for further thought on this, as this composition has arisen by my will."

32: >
  "O great sage, compose the entire story of Rama, the virtuous and wise one, as you have heard it from Narada."

33: >
  "Recite the deeds of the noble and steadfast Rama, both those that are known and those that are secret, as you have learned from Narada."

34: >
  "Recite all the events involving Rama, Lakshmana, the rakshasas, and Vaidehi, whether publicly known or hidden."

35: >
  "Even those details unknown to you will become known. In this poem, not a single word will be untrue."

36: >
  "Compose the sacred story of Rama in captivating verse. As long as mountains and rivers exist on earth, the tale of Ramayana will endure."

37: >
  "As long as your account of Rama's story circulates in the world, you will live in the celestial realms above and below."

38: >
  After saying this, the divine Brahma disappeared from that place, and the sage, with his disciple, was filled with wonder.

39: >
  The disciples then joyfully repeated that verse again and again, filled with amazement at its beauty.

40: >
  The verse composed by the great sage, with four metrical feet, transformed his grief into poetry through repeated recitation.

41: >
  Thus, Valmiki, filled with pure thought and profound wisdom, decided, "I will compose the entire Ramayana in such verse."

42: >
  Using elegant and meaningful words, Valmiki, a man of noble vision, created the Ramayana, a poem in hundreds of verses, filled with the glory of the famous Rama.

43: >
  This sacred narrative, skillfully composed with brevity, smoothness, and sweetness, tells the story of the illustrious Raghu clan and the downfall of Ravana.

  Thus, is the 2nd chapter in the Childhood Section
  of Valmiki Ramayanam, named 'Brahma's Arrival'.
