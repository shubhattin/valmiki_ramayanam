  of Valmiki Ramayanam, named 'Bestowing Education'.

1: >
  When Vasishtha spoke thus, King Dasharatha himself, with a joyful face, summoned Rama along with Lakshmana.

2: >
  Having performed the rites for auspiciousness by his mother and King Dasharatha, and being blessed with sacred hymns by Vasishtha, the priest,

3: >
  The king then, with a delighted heart, kissed his son's head and gave Rama to the son of Kushika.

4: >
  When the lotus-eyed Rama set forth with Vishwamitra, the wind blew gently without dust.

5: >
  A great shower of flowers fell with the sound of celestial drums, and the conch and kettle drums resounded as the great sage proceeded.

6: >
  Vishwamitra led the way, and the highly renowned Rama, with his youthful locks and holding a bow, followed, with Lakshmana accompanying him.

7: >
  The two brothers, bearing quivers and carrying bows, adorned the ten directions, resembling the two serpents with three heads accompanying Vishwamitra, the great sage.

8: >
  Unblemished, they followed him like the Ashvins following their grandfather, brightened with beauty and magnificence.

9: >
  The sons of Dasharatha, carrying their bows and beautifully adorned, with gloves of skin and bearing swords, followed the son of Kushika.

10: >
  The two brothers, Rama and Lakshmana, graceful in appearance, followed him with brilliance and splendor, unblemished and glorious.

11: >
  Like the great god Sthanu (Shiva), incomprehensible, or the sons of Agni (Kartikeya), the two brothers followed, covering a journey of a yojana and a half on the southern bank of the Sarayu.

12: >
  Vishwamitra then addressed Rama in a gentle voice, "Take the water, my son, so that the time may not pass."

13: >
  "Receive the collection of mantras, Bala and Atibala. With them, fatigue, fever, or any change in form will never occur to you.

14: >
  "No demons can overpower you, even if asleep or inattentive. In valor, no one on earth is equal to your arms, O hero.

15: >
  "In the three worlds, O Rama, there will be no one equal to you as you recite Bala and Atibala, O son of the Raghus.

16: >
  "In beauty, charm, wisdom, and determination, in responding appropriately, O sinless one, no one in the world will be equal to you.

17: >
  "With the acquisition of these two mantras, there will be none like you. Bala and Atibala are the mothers of all knowledge.

18: >
  "O best among men, hunger and thirst will not afflict you as you recite Bala and Atibala, O son of the Raghus.

19: >
  "Receive these mantras for the protection of the entire world, O delight of the Raghus. Whoever learns these two mantras will attain fame on earth. These mantras, full of brilliance, are the daughters of Brahma himself.

20: >
  "It is appropriate to give them to you, O descendant of Kakutstha, for you are deserving. Indeed, there is no doubt that you are capable of holding all virtues.

21: >
  "These mantras, gathered through austerity, will manifest in many forms." Then Rama, with a delighted face and purified, touched the water.

22: >
  The noble-minded Rama, of great prowess, accepted those mantras from the sage. Enhanced by these teachings, he shone like the sun of a thousand rays in autumn.

23: >
  Entrusting all duties to the son of Kushika, the three—Vishwamitra, Rama, and Lakshmana—spent the night there on the banks of the Sarayu, in great comfort.

24: >
  The night appeared delightful, as if rejoicing, due to the presence of the best sons of King Dasharatha, lying on a bed of grass not befitting them, yet pleased by the words of Kushika's son.
