  And now, the 13th chapter in the Childhood Section
  of Valmiki Ramayanam, named 'Entering Ritual Grounds'.

1: >
  When the spring season had arrived again, and a full year had passed, the valiant king set out to perform the horse sacrifice for the sake of progeny.

2: >
  Bowing his head and respectfully worshipping Vasishta, the king humbly addressed the best of Brahmins for the sake of having children.

3: >
  "O Brahmin, let my sacrifice be performed according to the prescribed rites, so that no obstacles may arise in the proceedings."

4: >
  "You are my dear friend and supreme guide, and the responsibility of this great sacrifice lies with you."

5: >
  The excellent Brahmin replied, "As you wish, O king, I will carry out everything as you have asked."

6: >
  Then, the king instructed the wise and elderly Brahmins, those well-versed in the sacrificial rites, as well as experienced builders and architects.

7: >
  He called upon skilled craftsmen, carpenters, diggers, sculptors, and artists, as well as dancers and performers.

8: >
  "Gather learned men, those skilled in the scriptures and in the sacrificial rituals, as per the king's orders."

9: >
  "Let the bricks be gathered in thousands, and let the structures for the sacrifice be built with great care and excellence."

10: >
  "Let many hundreds of Brahmin residences be constructed, well-stocked with food, drink, and all necessities."

11: >
  "Also, make extensive arrangements for the citizens, as well as for kings coming from distant lands, each with their own accommodations."

12: >
  "Prepare stables for horses and elephants, as well as shelters for guards and foreign visitors."

13: >
  "Make sure that these places are well-stocked with food, and that all the citizens are provided with delightful arrangements."

14: >
  "Food should be distributed respectfully, according to proper conduct, not carelessly, and all the varnas (classes) should be honored with due respect."

15: >
  "Even those who are engaged in the construction and rituals, including artisans and workers, should not be treated with disdain."

16: >
  "They should be honored appropriately with gifts and meals, according to the prescribed procedures."

17: >
  "Make sure that everything is well-organized, so that nothing is left incomplete. Perform all duties with a heart full of joy."

18: >
  Then, all the assembled men approached Vasishta and said, "Everything has been arranged as instructed, and nothing has been left undone."

19: >
  "We will carry out everything as ordered, without leaving anything unfinished," they said, to which Vasishta then summoned Sumanta and spoke to him.

20: >
  "Invite all the righteous kings of the world, along with thousands of Brahmins, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas, and Shudras."

21: >
  "Bring people from all regions, showing them proper respect, especially the valiant King Janaka of Mithila, who always speaks the truth."

22: >
  "Bring him with great honor, for he is an earlier ally. That is why I first mention him to you."

23: >
  "Also, invite the king of Kashi, who is affectionate, always speaks kindly, is of noble conduct, and is divine in appearance."

24: >
  "Bring the elderly, highly righteous King of Kekaya, the father-in-law of the lion-like king, along with his sons."

25: >
  "Invite Romapada, the great archer and king of Anga, who is the dear friend of the lion-hearted king, along with his sons."

26: >
  "Also, bring the refined King Bhanumanta of Kosala and the brave, scholarly king of Magadha, who is skilled in all scriptures."

27: >
  "Convey the king's orders to the great kings of the eastern regions, the Sindhu, Sauvira, and Saurashtra regions."

28: >
  "Invite the kings of the southern regions and any other kings on Earth who are affectionate and loyal."

29: >
  "Quickly bring all these kings, along with their entourages and families, through messengers of great merit."

30: >
  Hearing Vasishta's words, Sumanta immediately gave instructions to his men to bring the invited kings.

31: >
  Sumanta himself, as a righteous man, hurriedly set out, following the sage's orders, to bring the great kings.

32: >
  Meanwhile, all the artisans and workers reported to the great sage Vasishta about all the preparations that had been made for the sacrifice.

33: >
  The excellent Brahmin, Vasishta, pleased with their work, instructed them, "Do not give anything carelessly or with disrespect, as it would harm the giver."

34: >
  In a few days, many kings arrived, bringing with them abundant treasures for King Dasharatha.

35: >
  Vasishta, greatly pleased, then addressed the king, "O King, the great kings have arrived at your command."

36: >
  "I have duly honored them all as befits their rank, and everything necessary for the sacrifice has been meticulously prepared."

37: >
  "Now you should proceed to the sacrificial ground, which has been beautifully adorned with all the desired offerings."

38: >
  "O King, come and see the sacrificial site, which looks as though it has been created by your own mind, perfectly arranged in every way."

39: >
  Thus, following the words of Vasistha and Rishyashringa, the king (Dasharatha) set out on an auspicious day under a favorable constellation.

40: >
  Then, Vasistha, along with all the other eminent Brahmins, led by Rishyashringa, began the sacrificial rites.

41: >
  All of them proceeded to the sacrificial ground according to the prescribed rituals, and the illustrious king, accompanied by his wives, entered into the vows of initiation for the sacrifice.

  Thus, is the 13th chapter in the Childhood Section
