  Receiving the divine weapons, pure and with a joyful face, Rama then spoke to Vishwamitra as they continued their journey:

2: >
  "I have received the weapons, O revered one, and have become invincible, even to the gods. O eminent sage, I also wish to learn how to retract these weapons."

3: >
  Hearing Kakutstha's words, the great ascetic Vishwamitra, full of resolve and purity, began to teach him the methods of retraction.

4: >
  "I grant you the power of retraction for the weapons known as Satyavanta, Satyakirti, Dhrita, and Rabhasa.

5: >
  "And for the weapons named Pratiharatara, Parangmukha, and Avangmukha, as well as Lakshya and Alakshya, along with Dridhanabha and Sunabha.

  "O Rama, receive these luminous, powerful sons of Krishashva, capable of assuming various forms, for you are deserving, O Raghava.

11: >
  "Thus addressed, Kakutstha gladly accepted, and in radiant, divine forms, the retracted weapons appeared, comforting and pleasing.

12: >
  "Some of them looked like burning embers, some resembled smoke, while others were as bright as the sun and the moon, standing with folded hands.

13: >
  "With joined palms, they spoke sweetly to Rama, 'O tiger among men, command us—what should we do for you?'

14: >
  "Raghunandana replied, 'Depart as you wish, but assist me mentally whenever the need arises.'

15: >
  "Then, bidding Rama farewell, they circumambulated him and said, 'So be it, O Kakutstha,' before leaving as they had come.

16: >
  "Recognizing their departure, Rama then addressed the great sage Vishwamitra with a gentle and sweet voice as they continued walking:

17: >
  "'What is that grove resembling a cloud that appears not far from the mountain? My curiosity is piqued.

18: >
  "'It looks beautiful, filled with deer, and is adorned with various delightful birds, making charming sounds.

19: >
  "'We seem to have emerged from the terrifying forest, O foremost of sages, and by the pleasantness of this region, I sense comfort and peace here.

20: >
  "'Please tell me everything, O revered one. Whose hermitage is this, into which those sinful demons, murderers of Brahmanas, have come?

21: >
  "'For the purpose of obstructing your sacrifice, those wicked ones were here. O great sage, what is this place? Where is the site of your sacrifice?

22: >
  "'I wish to know everything, O best of sages. I will protect your sacrificial rites and slay the Rakshasas. I wish to hear all of this from you, O lord.'"
