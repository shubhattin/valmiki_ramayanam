'0': Thus begins the sixty-seventh chapter, named 'The Encounter with the King of Vultures', in the Aranya Kanda of the sacred Ramayana composed by the sage Valmiki.
'1': Raghava, though elder, accepted the well-spoken words of Lakshmana, which were full of great essence and wisdom.
'2': The mighty-armed Rama, restraining his growing anger and holding his magnificent bow, spoke to Lakshmana.
'3': '"What shall we do, dear Lakshmana? Where shall we go? By what means shall we find Sita? Contemplate on this."'
'4': 'To him, who was thus tormented by grief, Lakshmana spoke these words: "You should search this very region of Janasthana."'
'5': '"It is filled with many Rakshasas and is adorned with various trees and creepers. Here are mountain fortresses, ravines, and caves."'
'6': '"There are various dreadful caves filled with different groups of animals, and the abodes of Kinnaras and the dwellings of Gandharvas."'
'7': '"You, endowed with wisdom and great soul, should search these places with me. Great souls like you, O best of men, do not tremble in adversity, like mountains do not shake by the force of the wind."'
'8': Thus addressed, Rama, along with Lakshmana, searched the entire forest.
'9': Angry Rama, having strung a terrible arrow on his bow, then saw the great and noble vulture, resembling a mountain peak, lying on the ground, drenched in blood.
'10': Seeing him, resembling a mountain peak, Rama spoke to Lakshmana.
'11': '"This vulture has surely devoured Sita, the daughter of Videha, there is no doubt. This is clearly a Rakshasa in the form of a vulture roaming the forest."'
'12': '"Having devoured the large-eyed Sita, he rests at ease. I shall slay him with sharp and terrible arrows with blazing tips."'
'13': Having said this, angry Rama, shaking the earth as if it were the ocean's shore, advanced to see, with a sharp arrow strung on his bow.
'14': The bird, vomiting blood and speaking in a pitiable voice, addressed Rama, the son of Dasaratha.
'15': '"O long-lived one, the one whom you seek in this great forest, like a medicinal herb, that goddess and my life were both taken by Ravana."'
'16': '"Separated from you and Lakshmana, O Raghava, the goddess was seen by me being carried away by the mighty Ravana."'
'17': '"I approached Sita and Ravana in battle, O lord, and having shattered his chariot and umbrella, I fell to the ground."'
'18': '"This is his broken bow, and these are his arrows. This is his chariot, broken in battle, O Rama."'
'19': '"This is his charioteer, slain by my wings, lying on the ground. Ravana, having cut my wings with a sword, took Sita, the daughter of Videha, and flew into the sky."'
'20': '"Having been previously struck down by the Rakshasa, you should not kill me."'
'21': Rama, recognizing the dear story related to Sita from him, embraced the king of vultures, abandoning his great bow.
'22': Falling helplessly to the ground, he wept along with Lakshmana, though being the most resolute, Rama was afflicted with doubled grief.
'23': Seeing him breathing heavily in distress, again and again, Rama, sorrowful, spoke to Saumitri.
'24': '"The kingdom is lost, dwelling in the forest, Sita is lost, and the bird is dead. Such is my misfortune that it would even burn fire."'
'25': '"Even if I were to cross the great ocean today, it would surely dry up due to my misfortune."'
'26': '"There is no one more unfortunate in this world, among the moving and non-moving, than me, by whom this great snare of calamity has been obtained."'
'27': '"This is my father''s friend, the king of vultures, of great strength, lying slain on the ground due to the reversal of my fortune."'
'28': Thus speaking many times, Raghava, along with Lakshmana, touched Jatayu, showing paternal affection.
'29': Embracing the king of vultures, whose wings were cut and who was drenched in blood, Raghava, releasing his words, fell to the ground, saying, "Where has Maithili, equal to my life, gone?"
'-1': Thus ends the sixty-seventh chapter, named 'The Encounter with the King of Vultures', in the Aranya Kanda of the sacred Ramayana composed by the sage Valmiki.
