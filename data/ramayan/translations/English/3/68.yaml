'0': In the sacred Ramayana composed by the sage Valmiki, in the Aranya Kanda, this is the sixty-eighth sarga, named "The Cremation of Jatayu."
'1': Rama, upon seeing the vulture lying on the ground, struck down by the fierce Ravana, spoke these words to Lakshmana, who was endowed with friendship.
'2': This bird, striving for my sake, has been slain by the demon in battle and is now giving up its life for me.
'3': The life force in this body is greatly distressed, O Lakshmana, and it looks at us helplessly, devoid of its voice.
'4': O Jatayu, if you are able to speak once more, tell me about Sita, may you be blessed, and also narrate the cause of your own demise.
'5': For what reason did Ravana abduct the noble lady? What offense did I commit that led to my beloved being taken by Ravana?
'6': How was her face, resembling the moon, at that time, O best of birds? What words did Sita utter during that moment?
'7': What is the strength, appearance, and deeds of that demon? Where is his abode, O dear one? Tell me as I inquire.
'8': Looking at Rama, who was lamenting like one without support, the virtuous Jatayu spoke these words with a faltering voice.
'9': She was abducted by the wicked Ravana, the lord of demons, employing a great illusion amidst a stormy day.
'10': O dear one, the demon cut off my wings as I was exhausted, and taking Sita, the daughter of Videha, he went southward.
'11': My life force is obstructed, and my vision is wavering, O Raghava. I see trees with golden tops.
'12': In the time it takes for Ravana to carry Sita away, the lost wealth is quickly regained by its owner.
'13': That moment is called 'Vinda,' and the lord of demons, Ravana, did not realize it. Having taken your beloved Janaki, he will soon perish like a fish that swallows the bait.
'14': Do not grieve for the daughter of Janaka, for you will soon enjoy the company of Vaidehi after slaying him in battle.
'15': As the vulture, who was not deluded, spoke to Rama, blood mixed with flesh flowed from his mouth as he was dying.
'16': He said, 'He is the son of Vishrava and the brother of Kubera,' and then the lord of birds relinquished his difficult-to-obtain life force.
'17': As Rama, with folded hands, kept saying, 'Speak, speak,' the life force of the vulture left its body and ascended to the sky.
'18': Placing his head on the ground, stretching out his feet, and casting his body, he fell to the earth.
'19': Seeing the vulture with coppery eyes, lifeless and resembling a mountain, Rama, afflicted with many sorrows, spoke to Lakshmana.
'20': For many years, this bird lived happily in the abode of the demons in Dandakaranya, and now it lies here, slain.
'21': Having arisen after many years, this one, who was long-lived, is now slain today, for time is insurmountable.
'22': Behold, O Lakshmana, this vulture, who was helpful to me, is slain. He approached Sita, taken by the mighty Ravana.
'23': Abandoning the great kingdom of vultures, inherited from his father and grandfather, this lord of birds gave up his life for my sake.
'24': Indeed, everywhere are seen the virtuous, who follow dharma, the valiant, and those who offer refuge, even among creatures of other births, O Saumitra.
'25': The sorrow of Sita's abduction has not affected me as much, O gentle one, as the destruction of the vulture for my sake, O scorcher of foes.
'26': Just as the illustrious King Dasaratha, my father, was worthy of worship and honor, so is this lord of birds.
'27': O Saumitra, bring the wood, I shall kindle the fire. I will cremate the king of vultures, who has died for my sake.
'28': I shall place the lord of the bird world on the pyre. I shall burn him, O Saumitra, who was slain by the fierce demon.
'29': The path that is attained by those who perform sacrifices, by those who maintain the sacred fire, by those who do not turn back, and by those who give land,
'30': Having been permitted by me, go to the supreme worlds, O great-souled king of vultures, sanctified by me, depart.
'31': Having said this, Rama, the righteous soul, placed the lord of birds on the blazing pyre and burned him, grieving as if for his own kin.
'32': Then Rama, along with the valiant Lakshmana, went to the forest, and after killing large and mighty boars, they offered them to the bird.
'33': Taking out the flesh of the boars, cutting it into pieces, the illustrious Rama offered it to the bird on the beautiful green grass.
'34': What the twice-born say about the rites for the deceased, that going to heaven, and the ancestral rites, Rama performed for him.
'35': Then, going to the Godavari river, the two sons of the best of men performed the water rites for the king of vultures.
'36': Having bathed according to the scriptural injunctions, the Raghavas performed the water rites for the king of vultures.
'37': That king of vultures, having performed a glorious and extremely difficult deed, was slain in battle, and having been sanctified by one resembling a great sage, attained a blessed and auspicious state.
'38': Having performed the water rites for the best of birds, and having resolved firmly, they entered the forest with their minds set on finding Sita, like Indra and Vishnu.
'-1': Thus ends the sixty-eighth sarga, named "The Cremation of Jatayu," in the Aranya Kanda of the first epic, the holy Ramayana composed by Valmiki.
