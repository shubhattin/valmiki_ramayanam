'0': Thus begins the eighteenth chapter, named "The Mutilation of Shurpanakha," in the Aranya Kanda of the sacred Ramayana composed by the sage Valmiki.
'1': Rama, seeing Shurpanakha ensnared by the bonds of desire, spoke to her with a gentle smile and in a soft voice.
'2': O lady, I am already married, and this is my beloved wife. For women like you, having a co-wife is very distressing.
'3': However, this is my younger brother, Lakshmana, who is virtuous, handsome, and unmarried. He is a man of great prowess.
'4': He is young, charming, and seeks a wife. He would be a suitable husband for you, matching your beauty.
'5': O large-eyed one, accept him as your husband, my brother, and be without a co-wife, like the sun's rays on Mount Meru.
'6': Thus addressed by Rama, the demoness, infatuated with desire, immediately left Rama and approached Lakshmana.
'7': O handsome one, I am a suitable wife for you. With me, you will happily roam all over the Dandaka forest.
'8': Thus addressed by the demoness, Lakshmana, skilled in speech, remembered Shurpanakha and spoke appropriately.
'9': How can you, a maidservant, wish to become the wife of a servant like me? I am dependent on my noble brother, O lotus-hued one.
'10': O large-eyed one, you should become the younger wife of my noble brother, who is prosperous and accomplished.
'11': He will abandon this ugly, wicked, old wife with a sunken belly and take you as his wife.
'12': Who, O beautiful one, would abandon such a splendid form as yours and, being wise, choose a human woman?
'13': Thus addressed by Lakshmana, the hideous, sunken-bellied demoness, lacking discernment, believed his words to be true.
'14': She approached Rama, who was seated in the leaf-hut with Sita, the formidable one, and spoke, infatuated with desire.
'15': Having taken this ugly, wicked, old wife with a sunken belly, you do not regard me highly.
'16': Today, I will devour this human woman before your eyes and roam with you happily, without a co-wife.
'17': Having said this, the demoness, with eyes like a doe's and resembling a blazing firebrand, rushed towards Sita in great anger.
'18': Seeing her, resembling the noose of death, rushing towards him, the mighty Rama, in anger, restrained her and spoke to Lakshmana.
'19': O Lakshmana, with cruel and ignoble ones, jesting should never be done. See to it that Vaidehi somehow remains alive, O gentle one.
'20': O tiger among men, you should disfigure this hideous, wicked, and excessively arrogant demoness.
'21': Thus addressed by Rama, the mighty Lakshmana, in anger, drew his sword and cut off her ears and nose while Rama watched.
'22': With her ears and nose severed, she cried out loudly and fled into the forest as she had come, the dreadful Shurpanakha.
'23': Disfigured, the terrifying demoness, drenched in blood, roared various sounds like a cloud in the rainy season.
'24': Bleeding profusely, the dreadful-looking demoness, raising her arms, entered the great forest, roaring.
'25': Then, disfigured, she approached her brother Khara, who was surrounded by a host of demons in Janasthana, and fell to the ground like a thunderbolt from the sky.
'26': Thus, the sister of Khara, overwhelmed by fear and delusion, drenched in blood, narrated everything about her disfigurement to her brother, who had come to the forest with his wife and Lakshmana.
'-1': Thus ends the eighteenth chapter, named "The Mutilation of Shurpanakha," in the Aranya Kanda of the sacred Ramayana composed by the sage Valmiki.
