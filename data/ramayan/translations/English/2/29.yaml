'0': Then, in the sacred Ramayana composed by the sage Valmiki, in the Ayodhya Kanda, the twenty-ninth sarga named 'The Insistence on Accompanying to the Forest' begins.
'1': Hearing these words of Rama, Sita, filled with sorrow, with tears streaming down her face, slowly spoke these words.
'2': The faults you have mentioned regarding dwelling in the forest, know them to be virtues, as they are presented with love for you.
'3': The deer, lions, elephants, tigers, and sarabhas, as well as the camaras and srimaras, and other forest-dwelling creatures.
'4': All of them, having never seen such a form before, O Raghava, upon seeing your form, would retreat, for they all fear you.
'5': I must go with you, as per the command of the elders. Without you, O Rama, I must abandon my life here.
'6': Even Indra, the lord of the gods, O Raghava, is not capable of overpowering me with his might when I am near you.
'7': A woman without her husband cannot live. O Rama, you have shown me such a situation.
'8': Moreover, O wise one, I have heard from the Brahmanas, in my father's house, that I must indeed dwell in the forest.
'9': Having heard the words from the Brahmanas, I have always been eager for forest dwelling, O mighty one.
'10': The command for forest dwelling must indeed be fulfilled by me. Therefore, I shall go with you, my husband, and not otherwise.
'11': I shall fulfill the command and go with you. The time has come, let the words of the Brahmanas be true.
'12': I know that in forest dwelling, many hardships are indeed encountered by men of uncontrolled minds.
'13': In my father's house, I heard of forest dwelling from a mendicant woman, who lived a life of peace, in front of my mother.
'14': You have been propitiated by me for a long time, O lord, for the desired journey to the forest with you.
'15': I am ready, O Raghava, for the journey to the forest. The conduct of a hero in forest dwelling pleases me.
'16': With a pure heart, out of love, I shall be free from sin, following my husband, for the husband is the supreme deity.
'17': In the afterlife, O auspicious one, my union with you will always be. For it is heard in the sacred texts of the illustrious Brahmanas.
'18': In this world, O mighty one, the woman who is given by her father with water, according to her duty, belongs to him even in the afterlife.
'19': Thus, why do you not wish to take me, your own virtuous wife, devoted to her husband, for what reason here?
'20': You ought to take me, O Kakutstha, who is devoted, pious, and equal in joy and sorrow, sharing your happiness and grief.
'21': If you do not wish to take me, who is thus sorrowful, to the forest, I shall resort to poison, fire, or water, as a cause of death.
'22': Thus, she pleaded in various ways for the journey, but the mighty-armed one did not consent to take her to the desolate forest.
'23': Thus addressed, she, the daughter of Mithila, was overcome with anxiety, as if bathing the earth with her warm tears falling from her eyes.
'24': Seeing her in such contemplation, the wise Kakutstha, wishing to dissuade her, consoled the angry Vaidehi in many ways.
'-1': Thus ends the twenty-ninth sarga named 'The Insistence on Accompanying to the Forest' in the Ayodhya Kanda of the sacred Ramayana composed by the sage Valmiki.
