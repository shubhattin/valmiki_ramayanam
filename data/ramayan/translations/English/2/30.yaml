'0': Thus begins the thirtieth chapter, named 'Consent to Exile', in the Ayodhya Kanda of the sacred Ramayana composed by the sage Valmiki.
'1': Consoled by Rama, the daughter of Janaka, Sita, spoke to her husband for the purpose of dwelling in the forest.
'2': Sita, unperturbed and with a broad chest, reproached Raghava with affection and pride.
'3': What did my father, the king of Mithila, think of you, O Rama, when he gave me to you, a woman in the guise of a man?
'4': If the world, out of ignorance, says that there is no great valor in Rama, it would indeed be false, like the sun not shining.
'5': What have you done to be despondent, or what fear do you have, that you wish to abandon me, who has no other refuge?
'6': Know me to be devoted to you, like Savitri to the virtuous Satyavan, the son of Dyumatsena.
'7': I shall not, even in thought, see another apart from you, O sinless one, just as a chaste woman does not see another man.
'8': You wish to give me, your wife, who has lived with you since maidenhood, to others, like a dancer, O Rama.
'9': Be obedient and always under the control of him for whose sake you are abandoning me and for whose sake you are restrained.
'10': You should not set out to the forest without taking me, for whether it be penance or heaven, it is with you.
'11': There will be no fatigue for me on the path, following you, as if in a pleasure garden or on a bed.
'12': The grass, reeds, and thorny trees will feel like soft cotton and deerskin on the path with you.
'13': The dust raised by the great wind, O beloved, will seem like precious sandalwood to me.
'14': When I sleep on the grass in the forest, what could be more comfortable than that, with you, O Rama?
'15': Whatever leaves, roots, or fruits you give me, whether little or much, brought by you, will be like nectar to me.
'16': I will not remember my mother, father, or home, while enjoying the flowers and fruits of the forest.
'17': You should not see anything unpleasant there, nor will I be a burden to you, nor will there be any sorrow for you because of me.
'18': Heaven is with you, and hell is without you. Knowing this supreme love, go with me, O Rama.
'19': If you do not take me to the forest, I will drink poison now, so that I do not fall into the hands of enemies.
'20': Afterwards, I will not live in sorrow, for death is better than being abandoned by you, my lord.
'21': I cannot bear this grief even for a moment, let alone for fourteen years, O sorrowful one.
'22': Thus, tormented by grief, she lamented piteously and cried out, embracing her husband tightly.
'23': Pierced by many words, like an elephant by arrows, she released her long-held tears, like fire from a fire-stick.
'24': Her tears, clear as crystal, flowed from her eyes, like water from lotus petals.
'25': Her face, like a spotless full moon, with wide eyes, dried up with tears, like a lotus lifted from water.
'26': Embracing her with his arms, as if she were unconscious with grief, Rama spoke words of reassurance to her.
'27': O Devi, I do not desire even heaven with sorrow, nor do I have any fear, like the self-existent one.
'28': Without knowing your entire intention, O auspicious one, I do not desire to dwell in the forest, even though I am capable of protection.
'29': Since you were created with me for dwelling in the forest, you cannot be abandoned by me, like love by a self-controlled person.
'30': The duty practiced by the virtuous in ancient times, O lady with elephant-like thighs, I shall follow, like Suvarchala follows the sun.
'31': I would not go to the forest, O daughter of Janaka, if not for the truthful command of my father.
'32': This is the duty, O lady with beautiful hips, to be obedient to father and mother, and I cannot live by transgressing their command.
'33': How can one, not under one's control, propitiate fate in various ways, by transgressing mother, father, and teacher?
'34': Where the three worlds are purified, that is equal on earth, O auspicious one, and by that, this is propitiated.
'35': Neither truth, charity, nor sacrifices with abundant gifts are as powerful, O Sita, as service to one's father.
'36': Heaven, wealth, grains, knowledge, sons, and happiness are not difficult to obtain by following the conduct of the guru.
'37': The great souls, devoted to mother and father, attain the worlds of gods, Gandharvas, and Brahma.
'38': As my father commands me, established in the path of truth and righteousness, so I wish to act, for that is the eternal duty.
'39': My mind is not inclined, O Sita, to take you to the Dandaka forest, but you are determined to follow me.
'40': Therefore, O lady with faultless limbs, follow me to the forest, O timid one, and be my companion in righteousness.
'41': In every way, O Sita, it is befitting for you, of your own family, to follow this excellent resolve, O beloved.
'42': Begin, O lady with auspicious hips, the acts suitable for dwelling in the forest, for now, even heaven does not please me without you, O Sita.
'43': Give jewels to the Brahmanas, food to the beggars, and hasten, do not delay.
'44': Give the most excellent ornaments, fine garments, and whatever delightful playthings there are.
'45': Give the beds, vehicles, and whatever else is mine to your attendants, after the Brahmanas.
'46': Knowing her husband's favorable intention for her journey, the delighted queen quickly began to give.
'47': Then, the illustrious lady, with a heart full of joy, seeing her husband's words, began to give wealth and jewels, the noble-minded one, devoted to righteousness.
'-1': Thus ends the thirtieth chapter, named 'Consent to Exile', in the Ayodhya Kanda of the sacred Ramayana composed by the sage Valmiki.
