'0': Now begins the seventh chapter of the Ayodhya Kanda of the sacred Ramayana composed by sage Valmiki, named "The Lamentation of Manthara."
'1': A maidservant, born in the family of Kaikeyi, who lived with her, ascended a palace that resembled the moon, by chance.
'2': From that palace, Manthara beheld the entire city of Ayodhya, with its royal roads sprinkled with water and strewn with lotus and water lilies.
'3': The city was adorned with excellent banners and flags, sprinkled with sandalwood water, and filled with people who had bathed their heads.
'4': The city resounded with the sounds of Brahmins chanting, and was filled with people carrying garlands and sweets, and the doors of the temples were white.
'5': The city was filled with joyous people, resounding with the sounds of all musical instruments, and the streets were crowded with delighted people.
'6': Seeing Ayodhya, adorned with garlands of flags and filled with joyous and delighted citizens, Manthara was filled with great wonder.
'7': Seeing a nurse standing nearby, with eyes wide open with joy and wearing white silk, Manthara asked her.
'8': Filled with great joy and intent on her purpose, she asked, "Why is Rama's mother giving wealth to the people?"
'9': '"Why is there such great joy among the people? Tell me, what is the king, filled with delight, going to do?"'
'10': The nurse, overwhelmed with joy and filled with great delight, then told the hunchback about the great fortune of Rama.
'11': '"Tomorrow, under the Pushya star, the king Dasharatha will consecrate the sinless Rama, who has conquered anger, as the heir-apparent."'
'12': Hearing the nurse's words, the hunchback, quickly filled with anger, descended from the palace that was like the peak of Mount Kailasa.
'13': Burning with anger, the evil-seeing Manthara spoke these words to Kaikeyi, who was lying down.
'14': '"Arise, foolish one! Why do you lie down? Fear is approaching you. You do not realize that you are overwhelmed by a flood of calamities."'
'15': '"You boast of your good fortune, but it is unstable like the current of a river in the rainy season."'
'16': Thus addressed by the angry and harsh words of the evil-seeing hunchback, Kaikeyi fell into great despondency.
'17': Kaikeyi said to the hunchback, "Is everything well, O Manthara? I see you with a sorrowful face, greatly distressed."
'18': Hearing Kaikeyi's sweet words, Manthara, skilled in speech, spoke with anger.
'19': Becoming more sorrowful, the hunchback, who wished well for her, spoke, causing despondency and creating division regarding Rama.
'20': '"O Queen, a great and eternal calamity has befallen you. King Dasharatha will consecrate Rama as the heir-apparent."'
'21': '"I am plunged into a bottomless fear, filled with sorrow and grief, burning like one in a fire, and have come here for your welfare."'
'22': '"O Kaikeyi, your sorrow will be my great sorrow, and your prosperity will be my prosperity, of this there is no doubt."'
'23': '"Born in a royal family, you are the queen of the king. How do you not understand the harshness of royal duties, O Queen?"'
'24': '"Your husband, who speaks of righteousness, is deceitful and harsh, though he speaks gently. You, with pure intentions, are deceived by him."'
'25': '"He, who is deceitful, will use meaningless conciliation with you, and today, with wealth, will unite with Kausalya."'
'26': '"The wicked one will remove Bharata from your relatives and will establish Rama in the kingdom, with all obstacles removed, in the morning."'
'27': '"Your enemy, under the guise of a husband, like a snake held by a child, desires your harm, though he pretends to wish for your welfare."'
'28': '"Just as an enemy or a snake, if ignored, would act, so has King Dasharatha acted towards you and your son today."'
'29': '"O child, accustomed to comfort, you are destroyed along with your relatives by the wicked one, who, with false conciliation, establishes Rama in the kingdom."'
'30': '"O Kaikeyi, quickly do what is beneficial for you, which is timely. Save your son, yourself, and me, who is a witness to this wonder."'
'31': Hearing Manthara's words, the auspicious-faced Kaikeyi rose from her bed, filled with joy, like the crescent moon in autumn.
'32': Greatly pleased and filled with wonder, Kaikeyi gave a divine ornament to the hunchback.
'33': Having given the ornament to the hunchback, the delighted Kaikeyi again spoke to Manthara.
'34': '"This, O Manthara, is the most pleasing news you have told me. What more can I do for you, who have told me this pleasing news?"'
'35': '"I see no difference between Rama and Bharata. Therefore, I am pleased that the king will consecrate Rama as the heir-apparent."'
'36': '"There is nothing more dear to me than this. O you who deserve pleasant words, you have spoken words like nectar. Therefore, I will give you a great boon. Choose it."'
'-1': Thus ends the seventh chapter of the Ayodhya Kanda of the sacred Ramayana composed by sage Valmiki, named "The Lamentation of Manthara."
