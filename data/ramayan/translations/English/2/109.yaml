'0': Thus begins the one hundred and ninth chapter, named "The Praise of Truth," in the Ayodhya Kanda of the sacred Ramayana composed by the sage Valmiki.
'1': Hearing the words of Jabali, Rama, the foremost among the truthful, spoke with great devotion and unwavering intellect.
'2': The words you have spoken here, for the sake of my welfare, appear as improper though they seem proper, and as unwholesome though they seem wholesome.
'3': A man devoid of boundaries, engaged in sinful conduct, and whose character is perceived as broken, does not gain respect among the virtuous.
'4': Whether noble or ignoble, a hero or one who considers himself a man, it is character alone that defines whether one is pure or impure.
'5': An ignoble person may appear noble, and one devoid of purity may seem pure; one lacking in virtue may appear virtuous.
'6': If I were to pursue this unrighteousness, disguised as righteousness, causing confusion in the world, abandoning the auspicious and devoid of proper conduct,
'7': Who, discerning between right and wrong, would esteem me, a man of ill conduct, a blemish upon the world?
'8': To whom shall I offer my conduct, and by whom shall I attain heaven, if I continue in this manner, devoid of a firm vow?
'9': This entire world follows the path of desire; as the kings conduct themselves, so do the subjects.
'10': Truth and compassion are the eternal conduct of kings; therefore, the kingdom is founded on truth, and the world is established in truth.
'11': The sages and the gods indeed regard truth as supreme; in this world, the speaker of truth attains the highest state.
'12': Just as people fear serpents, so do they fear those who speak falsehood; truth is said to be the supreme virtue and the root of heaven.
'13': Truth alone is the lord in the world; the goddess of prosperity always rests upon truth. All things are rooted in truth; there is no higher state than truth.
'14': Offerings, sacrifices, and austerities are indeed based on truth; the Vedas are established in truth, therefore one should be devoted to truth.
'15': One alone protects the world, one alone protects the family; one alone sinks into hell, and one alone is exalted in heaven.
'16': Why should I not uphold the command of my father, who is truthful in promise, and bound by truth?
'17': Neither out of greed, nor out of delusion, nor out of ignorance shrouded in darkness, will I break the bridge of truth, the promise made to my guru.
'18': It is heard that neither the gods nor the ancestors accept offerings from one who is untruthful, fickle, and unstable in mind.
'19': I myself perceive this truth, this righteousness, as inherent in my own soul; it is a burden borne by the virtuous, and for that reason, it is esteemed.
'20': I shall renounce the Kshatriya duty, which is unrighteous though it appears righteous, practiced by the base, cruel, greedy, and sinful.
'21': Sin is committed by the body, contemplated by the mind, and spoken by the tongue; these are the threefold sinful actions.
'22': The earth, fame, glory, and prosperity indeed seek a man; they behold him dwelling in heaven, therefore one should adhere to truth.
'23': It would indeed be ignoble if you, having considered me, speak these words with logical reasoning, 'Do this auspicious act.'
'24': How can I, having promised this exile in the forest to my guru, fulfill the words of Bharata, abandoning the words of my guru?
'25': The vow I made in the presence of my guru was firm; at that time, Queen Kaikeyi was delighted.
'26': Dwelling in the forest in this manner, pure and with regulated diet, offering to the ancestors and gods with roots, flowers, and fruits.
'27': Content with the five senses, I shall conduct the journey of life, free from deceit, faithful, and discerning between right and wrong.
'28': Having attained this field of action, one should perform the auspicious deeds; fire, wind, and the moon are the enjoyers of the fruits of actions.
'29': Having performed a hundred sacrifices, the king of the gods ascended to heaven; the great sages, having undertaken severe austerities, have gone to heaven.
'30': Hearing those words of atheism, intolerant and of fierce energy, the son of the king, condemning those words, spoke thus.
'31': Truth, righteousness, valor, compassion for beings, pleasant speech, and the worship of the twice-born, gods, and guests are said to be the path to heaven by the virtuous.
'32': Thus, understanding the matter correctly, the wise, adhering to the path of righteousness, perform all actions properly, desiring the attainment of the worlds, being vigilant.
'33': I condemn the act of my father, who accepted you, a person of perverse intellect, following such a path with such a mind, deviating from the path of righteousness.
'34': Just as a thief, so is a person of such intellect; know that an atheist is like that here. Therefore, the wise should not face an atheist, who is most suspicious to the people.
'35': People before you, the best among men, performed many auspicious deeds, conquering this world and the next; therefore, O twice-born, the offering and sacrifice are accomplished.
'36': Devoted to righteousness, united with the virtuous, radiant, and foremost in the quality of charity, non-violent, free from impurities, the sages are revered in the world.
'37': Thus, speaking these words with anger, the great-souled Rama, unyielding in spirit, was addressed again by the Brahmin with truthful and conciliatory words.
'38': I do not speak the words of atheists, nor am I an atheist, nor is there nothing. Observing the time, I became an atheist, and at another time, I would become an atheist again.
'39': And now, this time has come slowly, as I have spoken the words of atheism, for the purpose of turning you back, O Rama, and for the sake of appeasement, I have spoken this.
'-1': Thus ends the one hundred and ninth chapter, named "The Praise of Truth," in the Ayodhya Kanda of the sacred Ramayana composed by the sage Valmiki.
