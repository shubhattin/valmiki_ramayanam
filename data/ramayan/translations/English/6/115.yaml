'0': Thus begins the sacred sarga of the Vibhishana Abhisheka in the Yuddha Kanda of Valmiki’s Ramayana, the one hundred and fifteenth section of the illustrious epic.
'1': Upon beholding the slaying of Ravana, the gods, the celestial Gandharvas, and the daityas hastened forth in their own splendid chariots, exalting wondrous and auspicious narratives.
'2': They extolled the dreadful demise of Ravana achieved by Raghava’s mighty prowess, and recounted the glorious battle engaged by both the vanaras and the wise Sugriva.
'3': They further celebrated the deep affection and valour of Lakshmana—swift as the wind—as well as the unyielding fidelity of Sita and the unparalleled heroic prowess of Hanuman.
'4': Rejoicing in their divine mandate, the blessed ones advanced as Raghava, mounted on a celestial chariot bestowed by Indra, proceeded with a radiance akin to a sacred flame.
'5': With his sanction duly granted, the mighty-armed one paid homage to Matali, the esteemed charioteer of Indra, who, in turn, acceded to Raghava’s command.
'6': Seated upon that wondrous chariot, which descended promptly from the heavens, he was recognized as the foremost among the divine vehicles.
'7': In supreme delight, Raghava received Sugriva with all due ceremony, and Sugriva himself was respectfully greeted by Lakshmana.
'8': Venerable in the eyes of Hari’s celestial hosts, he reached the splendid stronghold; at that moment, Kakutstha addressed the assembly gathered nearby.
'9': Saumitra, imbued with inherent virtue, along with the radiant Lakshmana, anointed Vibhishana in the serene realm of Lanka, thus sanctifying him.
'10': This devoted and pious soul, whose past beneficence has been ever remembered, is indeed the very one I most desire, being a kinsman of Ravana.
'11': 'Accordingly, Saumitra enjoined: ''Behold Vibhishana, thus consecrated in Lanka,'' proclaiming his divine appointment.'
'12': After these words were uttered, the exalted one, filled with joy, presented a golden pot, which was received in the hand of the noble vanar-chief, the valiant Manojava.
'13': Then, as if dispensing the very waters of the ocean among honored beings, he swiftly departed; soon thereafter, the monkey host of Manojava advanced with great haste.
'14': Thereupon, the foremost among the vanaras, having procured water from the ocean, secured a singular pot and established it upon the highest ceremonial seat.
'15': With that very pot, Saumitra consecrated Vibhishana—the sovereign among Lanka’s Rakshasas—thereby instituting his reign under Rama’s divine rule.
'16': In strict accordance with ritual procedure and the chanting of sacred mantras, and surrounded by his dear companions, he sanctified all the Rakshasas as well as the vanaras.
'17': Rama, imbued with incomparable joy and satisfaction, beheld with delight as his devoted Rakshasa adherents renounced their former claims.
'18': Beholding Vibhishana consecrated in Lanka as the lord of the Rakshasas, Raghava, together with Lakshmana, was filled with supreme delight.
'19': Upon receiving the vast and magnificent kingdom conferred by Rama, Vibhishana pacified the established order and, with due reverence, approached Rama.
'20': Then, amid the distribution of delightful sweets and modest remonstrations, the urbane citizens and even the nocturnal wanderers, in unbridled joy, set their chariots in motion in his honour.
'21': Gathering them together, the indomitable Raghava addressed the assembly with felicitous benedictions, bestowing every blessing especially upon the valorous Lakshmana.
'22': Observing that his sacred duty had been accomplished and prosperity reigned, Rama accepted Vibhishana and solemnly vowed to fulfill his every wish.
'23': Then, that indomitable hero—firm as a mountain and with palms folded in reverence—spoke, as Rama addressed Hanuman, the fleet-footed warrior of unmatched swiftness.
'24': After bestowing his sanction, the great sovereign instructed the gentle Vibhishana to enter the city of Lanka and, with skilled eloquence, relate the martial deeds to Maithili.
'25': 'Moreover, he bade that it be proclaimed to Vaidehi along with the tidings of well-being to the illustrious Sugriva and Lakshmana: behold, the noble Ravana has been vanquished in battle.'
'26': Dear Hari, declare this beloved news here, for you alone, O Lord, are truly worthy to receive and convey this sacred message.
'-1': Thus concludes the sarga entitled 'The Consecration of Vibhishana' in the Yuddha Kanda of the sacred Valmiki Ramayana, a cherished segment of the ancient Adikavya.
