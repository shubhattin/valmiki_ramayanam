'0': Thus begins the eighteenth chapter of the Yuddha Kanda in the sacred Ramayana composed by the sage Valmiki, titled 'The Decision to Accept Vibhishana'.
'1': Then Rama, with a serene mind, having heard the words of the son of the wind, spoke to him, the invincible one, who had heard and was established in himself.
'2': I too have a certain desire to speak regarding Vibhishana. I wish to hear all of it from you, who are established in righteousness.
'3': One who has approached as a friend should never be abandoned. Even if there is a fault in him, this is not condemned by the virtuous.
'4': Then Sugriva, having spoken those words and deliberated, spoke further auspicious words, the foremost of the monkeys.
'5': Whether he is wicked or not, what kind of night-wanderer is he, who, having attained such a calamity, would abandon his brother?
'6': Who indeed would be such a one, who would not abandon him? Having heard the words of the king of the monkeys, and looking at all,
'7': Slightly smiling, the auspicious Lakshmana, the descendant of Kakutstha, spoke these words, his prowess being true.
'8': Without studying the scriptures and without serving the elders, it is not possible to speak such words as the lord of the monkeys has spoken.
'9': There is something very subtle, as it appears to me here. It is evident and also worldly, existing among all kings.
'10': Enemies, those born in the same family, and those who are neighbors are said to be the ones who strike in times of distress. Therefore, he has come here.
'11': Those born in the same family, who are without sin, honor their own well-wishers. This is generally the case with kings, but the auspicious one is to be suspected.
'12': The fault you have mentioned, in taking the enemy's strength, I shall speak to you according to the scriptures, hear this.
'13': We are not those born in the same family, nor is the demon desirous of the kingdom. The wise will indeed be, therefore Vibhishana is to be accepted.
'14': They will be unperturbed and delighted, having come together. This great sound of fear has come to each other. Thus, they will go to division, therefore Vibhishana is to be accepted.
'15': Not all brothers, dear one, are like Bharata. Nor are sons like me, nor friends like you.
'16': Thus addressed by Rama, Sugriva, along with Lakshmana, rose and, the great wise one, spoke these words, bowing down.
'17': Know this night-wanderer to be sent by Ravana. I think it is proper to restrain him, O best of the patient ones.
'18': This demon, with a crooked mind, has been sent here to strike you, trusting in you, O sinless one, trusting in me.
'19': Whether in Lakshmana, O mighty-armed one, he is to be slain along with his counselors. For he is the brother of the cruel Ravana, this Vibhishana.
'20': Having thus spoken to the best of the Raghus, Sugriva, the lord of the army, skilled in speech, then became silent.
'21': Having heard Sugriva's words and deliberated, Rama then spoke further auspicious words to the foremost of the monkeys.
'22': Whether he is wicked or not, what kind of night-wanderer is he, who is capable of doing even the slightest harm to me in any way?
'23': I would slay the demons, Danavas, Yakshas, and Rakshasas on earth with the tip of my finger, if I so desired, O lord of the monkey hosts.
'24': It is heard that a pigeon, when an enemy came seeking refuge, honored him according to the law and invited him with its own flesh.
'25': For he accepted him, who had come, the abductor of his wife. O foremost of monkeys, what then of a person like me?
'26': The son of the sage Kanva, Kandu, the great sage, hear the song sung of old, righteous and truthful.
'27': One should not kill, for the sake of compassion, even an enemy who has come with folded hands, destitute, seeking refuge, O scorcher of foes.
'28': Whether distressed or arrogant, if an enemy has sought refuge, he should be protected, even at the cost of one's own life, by one who has mastered himself.
'29': If he does not protect, whether out of fear, delusion, or desire, according to his ability and the law, that is a sin condemned by the world.
'30': The one who has sought refuge, perishing while the protector looks on, all his merit would go to the unprotected one.
'31': Thus, there is a great fault here in not protecting those who have sought refuge. It is unheavenly, disgraceful, and the destruction of strength and valor.
'32': I shall indeed perform the excellent words of Kandu, righteous and glorious, and it will be heavenly in its fruition.
'33': To one who has sought refuge even once, saying 'I am yours', I grant fearlessness from all beings; this is my vow.
'34': Bring him here, O best of monkeys, I have given him fearlessness. Whether it is Vibhishana or even Ravana himself.
'35': Having heard Rama's words, Sugriva, the lord of the monkeys, replied to Kakutstha, filled with friendship.
'36': What is strange in this, O knower of righteousness, O crest-jewel of the world, that you, noble one, speak thus, established in the path of truth?
'37': My inner self also knows Vibhishana to be pure. From inference and feeling, he is thoroughly examined from all sides.
'38': Therefore, quickly, let the great wise Vibhishana become equal with us, O descendant of Raghu, and let him enter into friendship with us.
'39': Then, having heard the words of Sugriva, spoken by the lord of the monkeys, the lord of men quickly went to meet Vibhishana, like Indra with the king of birds.
'-1': Thus ends the eighteenth chapter of the Yuddha Kanda in the glorious Ramayana of Valmiki, the first epic, titled 'The Decision to Accept Vibhishana'.
