'1': Then, at the break of dawn, Vibhishana, the mighty one, who was resolute in righteousness and duty, approached the palace of the king of the Rakshasas.
'2': The palace, resembling a mountain peak, was lofty like a mountain summit, with well-divided grand chambers and surrounded by a multitude of people.
'3': It was occupied by wise ministers who were devoted and protected on all sides by Rakshasas who were trustworthy and sufficient.
'4': The air was agitated by the breaths of intoxicated elephants, and it resounded with the loud sounds of conch shells and the commencement of musical instruments.
'5': The great pathways were crowded with women, and the palace was adorned with the finest ornaments and had golden spires.
'6': It was like the abode of the Gandharvas, the dwelling of the Maruts, and filled with heaps of jewels, resembling the abode of the Nagas.
'7': The valiant and radiant Vibhishana entered the abode of his elder brother, which was like a great cloud with the sun's rays spread out.
'8': He, of great splendor, heard the auspicious sounds of blessings being chanted by those versed in the Vedas, which were for the victory of his brother.
'9': He saw the Brahmins, who were well-versed in mantras and Vedas, being honored with vessels of curd, ghee, and excellent flowers and grains.
'10': Being honored by the Rakshasas, who were glowing with their own splendor, the mighty-armed Vibhishana bowed to the brother of Kubera, who was seated.
'11': He, skilled in conduct, approached the seat adorned with gold, which was befitting a king, and followed the proper etiquette.
'12': In private, in the presence of the ministers, he spoke to the great-souled Ravana, words that were exceedingly beneficial and based on reason.
'13': Having appeased his elder brother with gentle words, he, who understood the nature of time, place, and purpose, spoke, having seen the extremes of the world.
'14': Since the time Sita arrived here, O tormentor of foes, we have been witnessing inauspicious omens.
'15': The fire, though kindled with mantras, does not burn brightly, emitting sparks, smoke, and a sooty flame.
'16': In the fire sacrifices, in the fire chambers, and in the sacred places of Brahmins, reptiles are seen, and ants are found in the offerings.
'17': The milk of cows is spilled, the elephants are without rut, and the horses, though fed with fresh grass, neigh in distress.
'18': The donkeys, camels, and mules, O king, shed their hair and are not steady in their nature, even when cared for according to the rules.
'19': The cruel crows, in flocks, caw all around, and they are seen gathered in flocks on the tops of buildings.
'20': Vultures, in groups, hover over the city, and the female jackals howl ominously at both twilights.
'21': The loud cries of carnivorous animals and beasts are heard in groups at the city gates, along with the sounds of thunder.
'22': 'Therefore, in this situation, I suggest this expiation: O hero, let Sita be given to Rama.'
'23': If, out of delusion or greed, I have spoken this, even then, O great king, you should not find fault with me.
'24': This fault is observed in all the people here, among the Rakshasas, the Rakshasis, the city, and the inner apartments.
'25': All the ministers have refrained from giving this advice, but I must speak what I have seen or heard. After considering it according to justice, you should act accordingly.
'26': Thus, in the midst of his ministers, Vibhishana spoke these beneficial words to his brother Ravana, the foremost of the Rakshasas.
'27': Hearing those words, which were beneficial, of great import, gentle, based on reason, and timely, Ravana, who was afflicted with fever, spoke this reply.
'28': I do not see any fear from anywhere, nor will Rama ever obtain Sita. How will the elder brother of Lakshmana stand before me in battle, even with the gods and Indra?
'29': Having spoken thus, the destroyer of the army of the gods, the mighty and fierce warrior in battle, the ten-headed Ravana, then dismissed Vibhishana, who spoke words of truth.
'-1': Thus ends the tenth sarga named 'Vibhishana's Counsel' in the Yuddha Kanda of the Valmiki Ramayana.
