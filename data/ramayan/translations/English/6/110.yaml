'0': Thus begins the 110th Sarga of the Yuddha Kanda in the sacred Ramayana composed by Sage Valmiki, titled 'The Severing of Ravana's Hundred Heads'.
'1': As Rama and Ravana engaged in battle, all beings watched in awe, their hearts filled with wonder.
'2': The two warriors, filled with rage, charged at each other, their chariots clashing in the fierce combat.
'3': Intent on each other's destruction, they appeared terrifying, moving in circles and advancing and retreating in the battlefield.
'4': Their charioteers displayed various maneuvers, as Rama attacked Ravana and Ravana retaliated against Rama.
'5': Both chariots, moving with great speed, showered arrows upon each other, resembling clouds pouring rain.
'6': They roamed the battlefield like rain-laden clouds, demonstrating various movements in the fight.
'7': Facing each other once more, they stood with their chariots aligned, horses facing horses.
'8': Their banners intertwined as they stood, and Rama, with sharp arrows, struck Ravana's four radiant horses.
'9': Overcome with anger, Ravana released sharp arrows at Raghava, aiming to counter the attack on his horses.
'10': Though pierced by the powerful Ravana, Raghava remained unshaken and unperturbed.
'11': Rama then released arrows that resounded like thunder, targeting Ravana's charioteer.
'12': The swift arrows struck Matali, the charioteer of the gods, but caused him no harm or confusion.
'13': Angered by the assault on Matali, Rama unleashed a barrage of arrows, turning his enemy away.
'14': Raghava, the valiant hero, released arrows in twenties, thirties, sixties, hundreds, and thousands at the enemy's chariot.
'15': Ravana, the enraged lord of the Rakshasas, retaliated from his chariot with a shower of maces and clubs against Rama.
'16': The battle resumed, tumultuous and hair-raising, with the sounds of maces, clubs, and iron bars.
'17': The seven seas were agitated by the winds of the arrows, and the inhabitants of the netherworld were distressed.
'18': The earth, with its mountains, forests, and groves, trembled; the sun lost its brilliance, and the wind ceased to blow.
'19': The gods, along with Gandharvas, Siddhas, and great sages, were filled with anxiety, as were the Kinnaras and great serpents.
'20': May there be peace for cows and Brahmins, and may the worlds remain eternal. May Raghava be victorious over Ravana, the lord of Rakshasas, in battle.
'21': Thus praying, the gods and sages watched the dreadful and hair-raising battle between Rama and Ravana.
'22': The groups of Gandharvas and Apsaras, witnessing the unparalleled battle, compared the sky to the sky and the ocean to the ocean.
'23': They spoke of the battle between Rama and Ravana as if it were the battle between Rama and Ravana itself, observing the combat.
'24': Then, with great anger, Rama, the enhancer of the Raghu dynasty's glory, fitted an arrow resembling a serpent to his bow.
'25': He severed Ravana's head, adorned with shining earrings, which fell to the ground, witnessed by the three worlds.
'26': Another head, identical to the first, arose from Ravana's body, which Rama swiftly severed again.
'27': A second head of Ravana was cut off in the battle by Rama's arrows, yet another appeared immediately.
'28': Even that was severed by Rama's arrows, resembling thunderbolts, and thus a hundred heads were cut off, all equally radiant.
'29': Yet, the end of Ravana's life was not in sight, despite the severing of his heads.
'30': Then, the valiant Rama, skilled in all weapons and the joy of Kausalya, pondered deeply.
'31': He thought of the arrows that had slain Maricha, Khara, and Dushana, and those that had vanquished Viradha in the Krauncha forest and Kabandha in the Dandaka forest.
'32': The arrows that had shattered the Sala trees, mountains, and the ocean, and those that had slain Vali.
'33': These arrows, which had always been reliable in battle, now seemed ineffective against the dull-witted Ravana.
'34': Thus absorbed in thought, yet vigilant in battle, Rama showered a rain of arrows upon Ravana's chest.
'35': Ravana, the enraged lord of the Rakshasas, retaliated from his chariot with a shower of maces and clubs against Rama.
'36': The great battle continued, tumultuous and hair-raising, in the sky, on the earth, and again on the mountain peaks.
'37': The gods, demons, Yakshas, Pisachas, serpents, and Rakshasas watched the great battle that lasted all night.
'38': Neither night nor day, nor even a moment or an instant, did the battle between Rama and Ravana cease.
'39': Without witnessing the victory of either the son of Dasaratha or the lord of the Rakshasas, the great charioteer of the gods, Matali, spoke swiftly to Rama, who was engaged in battle.
'-1': Thus concludes the 110th Sarga of the Yuddha Kanda in the sacred Ramayana composed by Sage Valmiki, titled 'The Severing of Ravana's Hundred Heads'.
