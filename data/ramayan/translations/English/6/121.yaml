'0': Thus begins the one hundred and twenty-first chapter of the Yuddha Kanda in the glorious Ramayana composed by sage Valmiki, titled "The Acceptance of Sita".
'1': Hearing the auspicious words spoken by the grandsire, the Fire God, Agni, rose up, taking Vaidehi (Sita) in his lap.
'2': Shaking off the funeral pyre, the Fire God, Agni, swiftly emerged, holding the daughter of Janaka in his form.
'3': She appeared like the rising sun, adorned with ornaments of molten gold, clad in red garments, with dark curly hair.
'4': Unblemished in her garlands and ornaments, of such form and faultless, the Fire God, Agni, placed Vaidehi in Rama's lap.
'5': Then, the Fire God, the witness of the world, spoke to Rama, "Here is your Vaidehi, O Rama, in whom there is no sin."
'6': '"Neither by word, nor by mind, nor by intellect, nor by sight, has this virtuous and noble lady ever transgressed you."'
'7': '"Abducted by the demon Ravana, intoxicated with power, she was separated from you, helpless and forlorn in the wilderness."'
'8': '"Confined in the inner chambers, guarded, her mind was fixed on you, devoted to you, protected by fearsome demonesses with dreadful intellects."'
'9': '"Though tempted in various ways and threatened, Maithili did not think of that demon, her inner self being focused on you."'
'10': '"Accept Maithili, pure in heart and sinless. You need not say anything further. I command you."'
'11': Then, with a pleased heart, Rama, the best among speakers, listened to these words. The righteous one, with eyes filled with joy, pondered for a moment.
'12': Thus addressed, the mighty and resolute Rama, the best among the upholders of dharma, spoke to the foremost of the celestials.
'13': '"Indeed, Sita deserves purification in the world, having dwelt for a long time in the inner chambers of Ravana."'
'14': '"The world would say, ''Rama, the son of Dasaratha, is indeed foolish and lustful,'' if I do not test Janaki."'
'15': '"I too understand Maithili, the daughter of Janaka, who is single-hearted, her mind fixed on me."'
'16': '"Even this wide-eyed lady, protected by her own splendor, Ravana could not transgress, like the ocean does not transgress its shore."'
'17': '"For the assurance of the three worlds, relying on truth, I disregarded Vaidehi entering the fire."'
'18': '"The wicked Ravana, even in thought, could not violate Maithili, who is unattainable, like a blazing flame."'
'19': '"She does not deserve distress, having been in Ravana''s inner chambers. Sita is indeed inseparable from me, like the radiance from the sun."'
'20': '"Maithili, the daughter of Janaka, is pure in the three worlds. She cannot be abandoned by me, like fame by a man of self-respect."'
'21': '"I must indeed do what is beneficial for all of you, the affectionate lords of the world, and what is spoken for my welfare."'
'22': Thus, having spoken, the victorious and mighty Rama, praised for his deed, united with his beloved, the illustrious Raghava, deserving of happiness, experienced joy.
