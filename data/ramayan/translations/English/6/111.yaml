'0': Thus begins the one hundred and eleventh chapter of the Yuddha Kanda in the glorious Ramayana of Valmiki, titled "The Slaying of the Paulastya".
'1': Then Matali reminded Raghava, as if he was unaware, "O hero, why do you follow this one?"
'2': '"Release the weapon of Brahma for his destruction, O lord. The time of his annihilation, as foretold by the gods, is now at hand."'
'3': Thus reminded by Matali's words, Rama took hold of the blazing arrow, which seemed to breathe like a serpent.
'4': This was the great arrow, given first to him by the venerable sage Agastya, endowed with the power of Brahma, unfailing in battle, and full of valor.
'5': It was originally created by Brahma, with immense energy, for the sake of Indra, and was given to the lord of the gods, who desired to conquer the three worlds.
'6': In its feathers resided the wind, in its tip the fire and the sun, its body was made of the sky, and in weight, it was like Mount Meru and Mandara.
'7': Blazing with splendor, well-feathered, adorned with gold, it was made with the radiance of all beings, and shone with the brilliance of the sun.
'8': Like the smoke-emitting fire of time, blazing like a venomous serpent, it was swift in piercing the hosts of men, elephants, and horses.
'9': Capable of breaking through gates, barriers, and mountains, its body was smeared with various kinds of blood, and it was exceedingly dreadful.
'10': With the hardness of a diamond, producing a great sound, it was dreadful in various battles, terrifying all, like a serpent breathing.
'11': It was a constant source of food in battle for vultures, eagles, cranes, jackals, and demons, resembling Yama in form, and fearsome.
'12': It was the delight of the monkey chiefs, the destruction of the demons, and was driven by various swift horses, beautiful and variegated, like Garuda.
'13': That supreme arrow, the destroyer of the fear of the worlds, the remover of the fame of enemies, and the bringer of joy to oneself,
'14': Then Rama, the mighty one, invoked that great arrow with mantras as prescribed in the Vedas, and fitted it to his bow with strength.
'15': As that supreme arrow was being fitted by Raghava, all beings were terrified, and the earth trembled.
'16': Enraged, he aimed his bow at Ravana and released the arrow, which was capable of piercing vital parts, with great concentration.
'17': Like the irresistible thunderbolt released by the arm of Indra, it fell upon Ravana's chest, like the inescapable time.
'18': That supreme arrow, with great speed, the destroyer of the body, pierced the heart of the wicked Ravana.
'19': Covered in blood, that arrow, the destroyer of the body, took away Ravana's life and entered the earth.
'20': Having slain Ravana, that arrow, with its task accomplished, returned to its quiver, as if quietly.
'21': From the hand of the slain one, his bow, along with the arrow, fell swiftly, as his life departed.
'22': The mighty and radiant lord of the Rakshasas, with his life departed, fell from his chariot to the ground, like Vritra struck by the thunderbolt.
'23': Seeing him fallen on the ground, the remaining night-stalkers, bereft of their lord, terrified, fled in all directions.
'24': The monkeys, wielding trees as weapons, roared and pursued them, having witnessed the slaying of the ten-headed one, victorious and shining.
'25': Tormented by the joyous monkeys, they fled towards Lanka in fear, with faces streaming with tears, due to the loss of their refuge.
'26': Then the victorious monkeys, filled with joy, roared, proclaiming the victory of Raghava and the slaying of Ravana.
'27': Then in the sky, the gentle celestial drums resounded, and the divine wind, carrying celestial fragrances, blew pleasantly.
'28': From the sky, a rain of flowers fell to the earth, showering the chariot of Raghava, enchanting and hard to obtain.
'29': In the sky, the excellent voices of the great-souled deities were heard, saying "Well done, well done!"
'30': A great joy entered the gods and the Charanas, with the slaying of the dreadful Ravana, who was a terror to all worlds.
'31': Then, pleased, Raghava fulfilled the desires of Sugriva, Angada, and Vibhishana, having slain the foremost of the Rakshasas.
'32': Then the Marut hosts returned to peace, the directions became clear, the sky became spotless, and the sun shone with steady light.
'33': Then Sugriva, Vibhishana, Angada, and the distinguished friends, along with Lakshmana, joyfully approached Raghava, victorious in battle, and worshipped him according to the rites.
'34': Thus, with his enemies slain, firm in his resolve, surrounded by his own forces, the delight of the Raghu dynasty, mighty and radiant, stood like Mahendra surrounded by the hosts of the gods.
'-1': Thus ends the one hundred and eleventh chapter of the Yuddha Kanda in the glorious Ramayana of Valmiki, titled "The Slaying of the Paulastya."
