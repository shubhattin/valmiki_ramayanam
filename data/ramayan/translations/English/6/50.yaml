'0': Thus begins the 50th Sarga of the Yuddha Kanda in the sacred Ramayana of Valmiki, named the Release from the Nagapasha.
'1': 'Then the mighty and powerful king of the monkeys, Sugriva, spoke: "Why is this army distressed, like a ship in water caught in a storm?"'
'2': 'Hearing Sugriva''s words, Angada, the son of Vali, replied: "Do you not see Rama and the great charioteer Lakshmana?"'
'3': The two valiant sons of Dasharatha, covered with a multitude of arrows, lie on a bed of arrows, their bodies drenched in blood.
'4': 'Then the lord of the monkeys, Sugriva, spoke to his son Angada: "This is not without reason; it must be due to fear."'
'5': With faces downcast, having abandoned their weapons, the monkeys flee in all directions, their eyes wide with terror.
'6': They do not feel ashamed of each other, nor do they look back; they push each other and leap over the fallen.
'7': In the meantime, the heroic Vibheeshana, holding a mace, approached Sugriva and offered blessings for victory to Rama.
'8': Seeing Vibheeshana, the terror of the monkeys, Sugriva spoke to the great soul, the king of the bears, who was nearby.
'9': This Vibheeshana has arrived, whom the monkeys, seeing, flee in great fear, mistaking him for Ravana's son.
'10': Quickly gather these greatly terrified monkeys, who are running in all directions, and inform them of Vibheeshana's presence.
'11': Thus addressed by Sugriva, Jambavan, the king of the bears, consoled the monkeys and stopped them from fleeing.
'12': Hearing the words of the king of the bears and seeing Vibheeshana, all the monkeys returned, abandoning their fear.
'13': Seeing the bodies of Rama and Lakshmana covered with arrows, the righteous Vibheeshana became distressed.
'14': With hands moistened with water, he wiped their eyes and, with a mind afflicted by grief, he wept and lamented.
'15': These two, endowed with strength and valor, dear to battle, have been brought to this state by the deceitful Rakshasas.
'16': By the crooked mind of this evil son of a Rakshasa, these two, straightforward in valor, have been deceived.
'17': Pierced with arrows and drenched in blood, these two lie on the ground like Shalyaka birds.
'18': Relying on whose valor I sought to establish my kingdom, these two best of men lie asleep, their bodies destroyed.
'19': Though alive, I am now ruined, my hopes of a kingdom lost; the enemy, Ravana, has fulfilled his desire.
'20': 'Embracing the lamenting Vibheeshana, the virtuous king of the monkeys, Sugriva, spoke these words:'
'21': '"You will obtain the kingdom of Lanka, O knower of dharma, without doubt; Ravana, with his son, will not achieve his desire here."'
'22': '"These two, Rama and Lakshmana, mounted on Garuda, will abandon their delusion and slay Ravana with his forces in battle."'
'23': Thus consoling and reassuring the Rakshasa, Sugriva spoke to Sushena, his father-in-law, who was by his side.
'24': '"With the brave monkey troops, take the two brothers, Rama and Lakshmana, to Kishkindha, when they regain consciousness."'
'25': '"I will slay Ravana, with his son and kinsmen, and bring back Maithili, like Indra recovering his lost prosperity."'
'26': 'Hearing these words of the king of the monkeys, Sushena spoke: "I recall the great war between the gods and demons of old."'
'27': '"Then the demons, skilled in the touch of arrows, repeatedly struck the gods, who were skilled in weapons, covering them."'
'28': '"Brihaspati treated those who were afflicted, unconscious, and lifeless with herbs and mantras endowed with knowledge."'
'29': '"Let the monkeys quickly go to the Milk Ocean to bring those herbs, Sampati, Panasa, and others."'
'30': '"The monkeys know the great herbs of the Himalayas, the divine Sanjivakarani, and the Vishalya, created by the gods."'
'31': '"There, in the excellent Milk Ocean, where the nectar was churned, are the supreme herbs, Chandra and Drona."'
'32': '"Those two mountains, placed there by the gods, are in the great ocean; let Hanuman, the son of the wind, go there."'
'33': In the meantime, the wind and clouds, with lightning, poured water into the ocean, shaking the mountains.
'34': With a great gust of wind, all the great trees of the islands fell, their branches broken, into the salt water.
'35': The serpents dwelling there were terrified, and all the aquatic creatures quickly went to the salt ocean.
'36': Then, after a moment, all the monkeys saw the mighty Garuda, son of Vinata, blazing like fire.
'37': Seeing him approach, the serpents, who had bound the two men with powerful arrows, fled.
'38': Then the great Garuda, touching the two descendants of Kakutstha, greeted them and caressed their moon-like faces with his hands.
'39': Touched by Vinata's son, their wounds healed, and their bodies became smooth and golden.
'40': Their energy, valor, strength, vigor, enthusiasm, and great qualities, as well as their intelligence and memory, doubled.
'41': The mighty Garuda, raising the two, who were like Indra, embraced them joyfully, and Rama spoke to him.
'42': '"By your grace, we have overcome the great calamity caused by Ravana and have quickly regained our strength."'
'43': '"As my heart rejoices upon seeing my father Dasharatha and my grandfather Aja, so it rejoices upon seeing you."'
'44': '"Who are you, endowed with beauty, wearing divine garlands and unguents, dressed in spotless garments, adorned with divine ornaments?"'
'45': The mighty and powerful Vinata's son, the king of birds, with eyes filled with joy, spoke to him.
'46': '"I am your dear friend, O descendant of Kakutstha, your life and breath, Garuda, come here to aid you both."'
'47': '"Neither the mighty Asuras nor the powerful Danavas, nor even the gods with Indra at their head, can release this terrible bond of arrows."'
'48': '"These serpents, sons of Kadru, with sharp fangs and filled with poison, became arrows by the power of the Rakshasa''s magic."'
'49': '"You are fortunate, O knower of dharma, Rama, with your brother Lakshmana, the slayer of enemies in battle."'
'50': '"Hearing this news, I came swiftly, out of affection for you both, maintaining our friendship."'
'51': '"You have been freed from this terrible bond of arrows; you must always be vigilant."'
'52': '"By nature, all Rakshasas are deceitful in battle; your strength lies in your straightforwardness and purity of heart."'
'53': '"Do not trust the Rakshasas in the battlefield; they are always crooked by nature."'
'54': Having spoken thus to Rama, the mighty Garuda, embraced him affectionately and prepared to depart.
'55': '"O Raghava, knower of dharma, affectionate even to your enemies, I wish to take leave and go as I please."'
'56': '"Do not be curious about our friendship, O Raghava; you will understand our friendship in battle, O hero."'
'57': '"Having left only the young and old in Lanka, you will slay the enemy Ravana with your arrows and recover Sita."'
'58': Having spoken thus, the swift Garuda, having made Rama free from pain, stood in the midst of the forest-dwellers.
'59': Then, having circumambulated and embraced the valiant Rama, Garuda, like the wind, entered the sky.
'60': Seeing the two sons of Raghu free from pain, the monkey leaders roared like lions and waved their tails.
'61': Then they beat drums and played mridangas, and joyfully blew conches, shouting as before.
'62': Others, the valiant monkeys, uprooted various trees and stood in hundreds of thousands.
'63': Emitting great roars, terrifying the night-dwellers, the monkeys approached the gates of Lanka, eager to fight.
'64': The tumultuous and dreadful sound of the monkey leaders was like the terrible roar of clouds at the end of summer, resounding at midnight.
'-1': Thus ends the 50th Sarga of the Yuddha Kanda in the sacred Ramayana of Valmiki, named the Release from the Nagapasha.
