'0': In the sacred Ramayana composed by the sage Valmiki, in the Uttarakanda, this is the forty-ninth sarga, named "The Entry into Valmiki's Ashrama."
'1': Seeing Sita weeping, the young ascetics there ran to the venerable and wise Valmiki.
'2': After bowing to the sage's feet, the young ascetics reported to the great sage the sound of her weeping.
'3': O venerable one, we have never seen this lady before. She appears like the consort of a great soul, lamenting with a distorted face, like the goddess of fortune in delusion.
'4': O venerable one, kindly behold her, like a goddess fallen from the sky. A certain noble lady is distressed on the riverbank, O venerable one.
'5': We have seen her weeping intensely, overwhelmed with grief. She, who is undeserving of sorrow and grief, appears alone and helpless.
'6': We do not know her to be human. Let her be accorded due respect. She has come to you for refuge, not far from the hermitage.
'7': This virtuous lady seeks a protector, O venerable one, you ought to protect her. Hearing their words, the sage, wise in dharma, determined with his intellect, and endowed with vision through penance, proceeded to where Maithili was.
'8': Perceiving the sage of great intellect approaching, his disciples followed him. The sage of great intellect, having approached that place, walked a little further.
'9': Taking a beautiful offering, he reached the bank of the Jahnavi and saw Sita, the beloved wife of Raghava, appearing helpless.
'10': Seeing Sita, burdened with grief, the eminent sage Valmiki spoke sweet words, as if soothing her with his brilliance.
'11': You are the daughter-in-law of Dasharatha, the beloved queen of Rama, and the daughter of King Janaka. Welcome to you, O chaste lady.
'12': As you approached, I recognized you through my meditative insight. The reason for your presence is also perceived by my heart.
'13': O noble lady, the truth of your situation is known to me. Everything that transpires in the three worlds is known to me.
'14': I know you to be sinless, O Sita, through the vision obtained by penance. Be at ease, O Vaidehi, for you are now under my care.
'15': Near my hermitage, there are ascetic women engaged in penance. They will care for you, O child, like a calf, always.
'16': Accept this offering, be at ease, and free from fever. When you return to your home, do not grieve.
'17': Hearing the sage's wondrous words, Sita, with folded hands, bowed her head to his feet and said, "So be it."
'18': Sita, with folded hands, followed the sage as he proceeded.
'19': Seeing the sage approaching with Vaidehi, the wives of the sages came forward joyfully and spoke these words.
'20': Welcome to you, O foremost of sages, after a long time. We all bow to you. Please tell us what we can do for you.
'21': 'Hearing their words, Valmiki spoke thus: This is Sita, the wife of the wise Rama, who has arrived here.'
'22': She is the daughter-in-law of Dasharatha and the virtuous daughter of Janaka. Though sinless, she was abandoned by her husband and is to be protected by me always.
'23': Let you all behold her with supreme affection. Out of respect for my words, let her be especially honored by you.
'24': The illustrious sage, repeatedly instructing them regarding Vaidehi, returned to his hermitage, accompanied by his disciples, after a while.
'-1': Thus ends the forty-ninth sarga, named "The Entry into Valmiki's Ashrama," in the sacred Ramayana composed by the sage Valmiki, in the Uttarakanda.
