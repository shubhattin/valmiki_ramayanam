'0': Thus begins the Sarga entitled “Lavanavadhah,” the ninety-seventh chapter of the Uttara Kāṇḍa of the sacred Valmīki Rāmāyaṇa, wherein the fatal destiny of the demon Lavana is to be recounted in all its divine detail.
'1': Upon hearing those words, the noble Shatrughna—his heart inflamed with furious wrath—commanded resolutely, “Stand firm, stand firm!”
'2': Lavana, extending his hand as if to seize his foe’s limb and baring his serrated fangs in fierce display, addressed the scion of Raghu with insulting epithets, thus challenging his martial lineage.
'3': With a grim and fearsome demeanor, Lavana uttered these contemptuous words; to this, Shatrughna—the illustrious vanquisher of enemies—responded with unwavering resolve.
'4': “O Lavana, thou who hast not subdued others by thine own hand, now, having been struck by mine arrow, hasten and retreat to the abode of Yama!” declared Shatrughna, pronouncing the doom awaiting his foe.
'5': Furthermore, he proclaimed that even the revered sages, upon witnessing thy sinful spirit felled in battle by me, shall see thee manifest in a grim likeness to Ravana, in triple form of defiance.
'6': “Thou, enemy, now that thou art singed by my arrow and brought low, shalt find no refuge either among the night-roaming demons or within the assembled community of men,” he declared.
'7': He continued, “Today the arrow, discharged from my very arm and dazzling as a thunderbolt, shall pierce thy heart with a brilliance comparable to the radiant lotus, fulfilling its destiny.”
'8': Thus having spoken, the wrathful Lavana hurled at the mighty tree with ferocity, yet Shatrughna, unfaltering in his valor, loosed his arrow which shattered the great trunk into a hundred fragments.
'9': Observing that his hostile deed had proved fruitless, the rakshasa, his limbs flailing like the branches of a great tree, once more advanced boldly to engage with Shatrughna.
'10': Then Shatrughna, resplendent and vigorous, caused a multitude of trees to fall; with his arrows he cleaved each one asunder into several parts, demonstrating his unmatched martial prowess.
'11': In the very moment the demon unleashed a volley of arrows, the valorous Shatrughna, imbued with indomitable spirit, stood unmoved, unaffected by the onslaught of the enemy.
'12': Laughing boldly, Lavana seized a tree with all his might and delivered a crushing blow to the head—so fierce that his limbs quivered uncontrollably, leaving him utterly bewildered.
'13': At the sight of this mighty warrior’s fall, a tremendous outcry arose, as if the very assembly of sages, gods, gandharvas, and apsarās had erupted in a tumult of awe and dismay.
'14': Disregarding the omens, Shatrughna was felled upon the earth; and though timely rescue was in prospect, he did not retreat into his own citadel to seek shelter.
'15': Nor did any warrior, even upon seizing a trident at the sight of his fall, prevent his destiny; when it was known that he was struck down, the slain bodies of the foes were gathered in solemn order.
'16': In that very moment when the dire incident was perceived, the warrior again readied his splendid arms; verily, Shatrughna was ceremoniously venerated by the revered rishis at the threshold of the city.
'17': Then, perceiving him as invincible and divinely ordained, he seized that peerless arrow—which, blazing with fierce, resplendent fire, illuminated all the ten quarters of the universe.
'18': That arrow, bearing a countenance as if of a thunderbolt and moving with the speed of lightning—reminiscent of the lofty Mount Meru—swept through the ranks of the enemy, leaving none unvanquished.
'19': It struck the figure whose body was darkened as though scorched by burning sandalwood, with limbs frail as delicate leaves; thereby it overthrew the strongholds of the daitya kings and the base of the asuric host.
'20': Beholding that brilliant form—as if he were the blazing conflagration of time at the epoch’s end—all beings hastened forth, rallying in an earnest attempt to offer succor.
'21': In the majestic assembly comprising gods, demons, gandharvas, rishis, and apsarās, the omnipotent protector of the universe—the great progenitor—was conspicuously present.
'22': Then he addressed, saying, “O Lord of Lords, Bestower of boons, great progenitor, I have come against that which sows terror among the gods and brings untold ruin upon the multitude of worlds.”
'23': “Never before,” he continued, “has there been witnessed or heard of such an overwhelming dread that strikes fear into the gods and heralds the devastation of worlds.”
'24': Upon hearing these dire words, Brahmā—the venerable father of the universe, whose very presence instills awe and terror—spoke in a melodious tone, “Listen, O all divine beings!”
'25': For the purpose of slaying Lavana, the arrow borne by Shatrughna shone with such dazzling brilliance that it left all the exalted devas utterly perplexed.
'26': This is the timeless arrow of that ancient deity—the eternal creator of worlds—imbued with radiant splendor, by which indeed the seed of fear was first implanted.
'27': Truly, this very arrow, magnificent and potent, was fashioned by the great soul for the annihilation of both the demon Kaṭabhā and that of Madhuna, fulfilling its lethal purpose.
'28': Only Viṣṇu, in his omniscience, perceives the brilliance of this radiant arrow; indeed, it was once the very embodiment of that illustrious essence of Viṣṇu himself.
'29': Now proceed and behold the demise of Lavana—the most formidable among demons—struck down by the valiant descendant of Rāma, whose prowess is without parallel.
'30': Hearing in turn the divine pronouncement from the Supreme Lord, the devas assembled at the very site where Shatrughna and Lavana engaged in fierce combat.
'31': That arrow—radiant with divine splendor and released by Shatrughna—was witnessed by all creatures, ascending like a mighty conflagration heralding the end of an age.
'32': Observing the heavens enshrouded as if by a celestial veil, Raghunandana, with a resounding roar akin to that of a lion, once more manifested his distinctive martial valor.
'33': Again, being challenged by the heroic Shatrughna, Lavana—his countenance inflamed with seething wrath—positioned himself resolutely for the impending battle.
'34': Then, swiftly drawing his bow—the foremost among archers—Shatrughna loosed the mighty arrow aimed directly at the formidable Lavana in the heat of combat.
'35': The arrow rent through the chest with a decisive stroke, swiftly penetrating into the very essence of Lavana’s being.
'36': Having pierced to the core, the divine arrow—revered by the wise—instantly reached its preordained mark, fulfilling its fate as the pride of the Ikṣvāku dynasty.
'37': Severed by Shatrughna’s inexorable arrow, Lavana—the nocturnal demon—was utterly dismembered, falling suddenly to the earth as if a formidable mountain had been shattered by a bolt of diamond-like force.
'38': Moreover, behold the mighty trident employed in the slaying of Lavana the demon—a weapon whose formidable power was observed by all the devas, its energy subjugated under the sway of Rudra.
'39': With one resolute, decisive strike, the heroic scion of Raghu brought Lavana crashing down, his fall affecting even the three worlds; that matchless arrow shone forth, emanating a thousand gleams in its radiant display.
'40': Thereafter, the gods, rishis, and nāgas—together with all the apsarās—offered their exalted worship, assured by the destined victory of Dasharatha’s lineage, dispelling every trace of fear as though subduing a venomous serpent.
'-1': Thus ends the Sarga entitled “Lavanavadhah,” the ninety-seventh chapter of the Uttara Kāṇḍa of the sacred Valmīki Rāmāyaṇa, encapsulating the complete and detailed account of Lavana’s fate.
