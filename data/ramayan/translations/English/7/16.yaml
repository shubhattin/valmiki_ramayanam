'0': Now begins the sixteenth chapter of the Uttarakanda of the sacred Ramayana composed by the sage Valmiki, titled 'The Acquisition of the Name Ravana'.
'1': Having conquered Kubera, the lord of wealth, the king of the Rakshasas, Ravana, proceeded to the great forest of Sharavana, which was the birthplace of Kartikeya, the son of Shiva.
'2': There, Ravana beheld the magnificent golden forest of Sharavana, enveloped in a network of rays, resembling a second sun.
'3': Ascending a certain mountain adorned with delightful groves, he saw the Pushpaka Vimana stationed there, obstructed by Rama.
'4': Seeing the Pushpaka Vimana, which was meant to travel at will, immobilized, the lord of the Rakshasas, surrounded by his ministers, pondered.
'5': '"For what reason does this Pushpaka not move at my desire? This must be the work of someone on this mountain top," he thought.'
'6': Then Maricha, wise in counsel, spoke to Ravana, "O King, the Pushpaka does not remain stationary without cause."
'7': '"This Pushpaka, which belongs to Kubera, does not move because it is bereft of its master, the lord of wealth," he continued.'
'8': While they were conversing thus, a fierce, dark, tawny-eyed, dwarf-like, grotesque, bald, and powerful being, Nandi, the attendant of Shiva, approached them without fear.
'9': 'Nandi, the lord of the Ganas, fearlessly addressed the king of the Rakshasas, '
'10': '"Turn back, O ten-headed one, for Shiva is sporting on this mountain. Suparnas, Nagas, Yakshas, Devas, Gandharvas, and Rakshasas, '
'11': this mountain is made inaccessible to all beings!" Upon Hearing Nandi's words, Ravana, with earrings trembling in anger, descended from the Pushpaka.
'12': With eyes red with rage, he alighted from the Pushpaka and, saying, "Who is this Shiva?", approached the base of the mountain.
'13': There he saw Nandi, standing at a distance, holding a blazing trident, resembling a second Shiva.
'14': Seeing the forest-dweller-faced Nandi, the Rakshasa, in disdain, laughed loudly, like a cloud releasing rain.
'15': Enraged, the divine Nandi, another form of Shiva, addressed the approaching Ravana.
'16': '"Because you have scorned me, O ten-headed one, and laughed at me, whose form is like that of a Vanara, as if struck by lightning," he said.'
'17': '"Therefore, Vanaras endowed with my form and equal in valor to me will arise to destroy your race," he cursed.'
'18': '"Fierce, armed with nails and teeth, swift as the mind, intoxicated with the desire for battle, and as powerful as mountains, they will be," he foretold.'
'19': '"They will, together with the sons of your ministers, destroy your excessive pride and arrogance," he prophesied.'
'20': '"What can I do now to kill you, O night-wanderer? You are already slain by your own deeds," he declared.'
'21': When the great-souled deity had spoken thus, divine drums resounded, and a shower of flowers fell from the sky.
'22': Disregarding Nandi's words, the mighty Ravana approached the mountain and spoke.
'23': '"Because my Pushpaka''s movement is obstructed by this mountain, I shall uproot it, O protector of cows," he declared.'
'24': '"By what power does Shiva sport here like a king, unaware of the danger that has come upon him?" he questioned.'
'25': Having spoken thus, Ravana, stretching out his arms, began to shake the mountain swiftly.
'26': Due to the shaking of the mountain, the attendants of the deity were agitated, and Parvati clung to Maheshvara in fear.
'27': Then, O Rama, the great god, the foremost of the deities, Hara, playfully pressed the mountain with his toe.
'28': As a result, Ravana's arms, which were beneath the mountain, were crushed, and his ministers were astonished.
'29': Due to the pain in his arms and the anger of the Rakshasa, a loud cry arose, shaking the three worlds.
'30': His ministers thought it was the end of the world, as if struck by a thunderbolt, and the gods, led by Indra, were disturbed.
'31': The oceans were agitated, the mountains trembled, and the Yakshas, Vidyadharas, and Siddhas wondered what was happening.
'32': Then his ministers said to the crying Ravana, "Appease the great god, the blue-throated lord of Uma."
'33': '"We see no other refuge here, O ten-headed one. Bow down with praises and seek refuge in him alone," they advised.'
'34': '"Shankara, who is compassionate, will be pleased and grant you grace," they assured.'
'35': |-
  Thus advised by his ministers, Ravana praised the bull-bannered deity with various hymns and songs.
  For a thousand years, the Rakshasa wept and praised, and then the time passed.
'36': Then, pleased, the great god, standing on the mountain peak, released Ravana's arms and spoke to him.
'37': '"I am pleased with your valor and prowess, O ten-headed one. The roar you released while seizing the mountain was terrible," he said.'
'38': '"Because you have caused fear in the three worlds with your roar, you shall be known as Ravana, O king, by name," he declared.'
'39': '"The gods, humans, Yakshas, and others on earth will call you Ravana, the terror of the worlds," he proclaimed.'
'40': '"Go, O descendant of Pulastya, without fear, by whichever path you desire. You have my permission, O lord of the Rakshasas," he granted.'
'41': Thus addressed by Shambhu himself, the lord of Lanka spoke, "If you are pleased, O great god, grant me a boon as I ask."
'42': '"I have obtained invincibility from gods, Gandharvas, Danavas, Rakshasas, Guhyakas, Nagas, and others who are stronger," he said.'
'43': '"I do not count humans, O god, for they are insignificant to me. I have also obtained long life from Brahma, O destroyer of Tripura," he added.'
'44': '"Grant me the remaining desired lifespan and a weapon," he requested.'
'45': Thus addressed by Ravana, Shankara granted him a great, blazing sword known as Chandrahasa and the remaining lifespan.
'46': Having given these, Shambhu said, "Do not disregard this. If you do, it will return to me, without doubt."
'47': Thus, by Maheshvara himself, Ravana was named. Bowing to the great god, he ascended the Pushpaka.
'48': Then, on earth, Ravana roamed, subduing the mighty Kshatriyas here and there.
'49': Some valiant and proud Kshatriyas, not submitting to his rule, perished along with their retinues.
'50': Others, knowing the Rakshasa to be invincible and esteemed by the wise, said, "We are conquered," to the Rakshasa, proud of his strength.
