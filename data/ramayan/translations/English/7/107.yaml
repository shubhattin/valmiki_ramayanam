'0': Now, in the Uttara Kāṇḍa of the revered Valmiki Rāmāyaṇa, begins the section entitled ‘Kushala Vābhisheka’—the one-hundred and seventh sarga.
'1': Forsaking Lakshmana, Rama—overcome with sorrow and grief—spoke to his chief minister, his counselor, and his trusted aide.
'2': He declared, “Today I shall invest Bharata, the one dear to dharma, with the regnal authority; thereafter, I, the valiant lord of Ayodhya, will retire to the forest.”
'3': He continued, “See to it that the royal stores, amassed in their proper season, are duly arranged; today, I embark on the journey along the path already trodden with Lakshmana.”
'4': Upon hearing Rama’s words, all the assembled attendants bowed their heads humbly to the earth, as if their very beings were humbled in deference.
'5': Bharata, having heard Rama’s pronouncement without reservation, responded resolutely, “I shall undertake the governance of the kingdom.”
'6': And Rama affirmed, “By my sacred vow, I am neither destined for celestial bliss nor do I desire to rule the kingdom in your absence, O delightful scion of Raghu.”
'7': He then instructed, “O King, consecrate these two illustrious scions—Kush, the valiant one in Kosala, and Lava, the brave one in Uttara.”
'8': Furthermore, he ordered, “Let the swift and heroic messengers hasten to Shatrughna; proclaim without delay that our departure is ordained for the heavenly realm.”
'9': Hearing Bharata’s words and beholding the citizens, their faces bowed in grief, the sage Vasishtha delivered his counsel.
'10': He addressed Rama, “O dear one, behold these subjects who are governed by nature; aware of the duty that is incumbent upon them, let not that which is dear be executed contrary to their true interest.”
'11': Inspired by the sage Vasishtha’s words, the assembled populace rose, and Kakutstha, speaking for all, inquired, “What course of action shall we adopt?”
'12': Then all the assembled subjects, in unison, addressed Rama, “We shall follow and accompany you wherever you may proceed.”
'13': They further declared, “If in the cities you bestow upon them the highest affection and love, then, O Kakutstha, those blessed with progeny shall gather together on the righteous path.”
'14': “Be it the ashram in the forest, a mighty fortress, the river’s banks, or even the treasures of the ocean; if you, O Lord, forsake us not, lead us all along with you,” they entreated.
'15': “This supreme affection is indeed our highest boon; may our hearts ever remain imbued with love as we follow in your footsteps, O King,” they declared reverently.
'16': Thus, one among them spoke, “Behold the unwavering devotion of the citizens is truly magnificent; now, having observed the fruition of my own deeds, O Raghava, what shall be our next step?”
'17': Rama then assured, “I have anointed and invested you all—Kush in Kosala and Lava in Uttara; you, the noble and virtuous ones, are now duly crowned.”
'18': Having crowned his sons and established them in the city, the mighty-armed one embraced them and ceremoniously placed a sacred garland upon their heads.
'19': He further bestowed upon each a thousand chariots, countless serpent-drawn vehicles, and a host of horses arranged in tens as a token of royal wealth.
'20': Moreover, he dispatched his brothers—adorned with numerous gems and abundant wealth and accompanied by jubilant, vigorous attendants—to his own city.
'21': After having crowned his valiant sons and established them in the city, he sent forth emissaries to the illustrious Shatrughna.
'-1': Thus concludes the section of the Uttara Kāṇḍa in the celebrated Valmiki Rāmāyaṇa, the Adikāvya, known as ‘Kushala Vābhisheka’—the one-hundred and seventh sarga.
