'0': Then, Rāma spoke to the sage, "How did your brothers live in the forest? What kind of penance did they perform, O Brahman, with their great strength?"
'1': Agastya, with a pleased heart, replied to Rāma, "Your brothers engaged in various religious practices there."
'2': Kumbhakarṇa, always devoted to the path of righteousness, stood amidst five fires during the summer.
'3': During the rainy season, he sat in the heroic posture, drenched by rainwater, and in the winter, he resided in the midst of water.
'4': Thus, ten thousand years passed for him, who was dedicated to righteousness and established in the path of virtue.
'5': Vibhīṣaṇa, the righteous soul, always devoted to dharma, stood on one foot for five thousand years.
'6': When his penance was completed, the groups of Apsarās danced, and a shower of flowers fell, and even the gods were agitated.
'7': For five thousand years, he followed the sun, standing with his head and arms raised, his mind absorbed in self-study.
'8': Thus, for ten thousand years, Vibhīṣaṇa, with a controlled mind, lived as if in the heavenly Nandana garden.
'9': For ten thousand years, Rāvaṇa, the ten-headed one, remained without food, and at the end of the thousand years, he offered his head into the fire.
'10': Thus, nine thousand years passed for him, and nine of his heads entered the sacrificial fire.
'11': Then, in the tenth thousandth year, as he was about to offer his tenth head, Brahmā arrived there.
'12': Brahmā, pleased, appeared with the gods and said to Rāvaṇa, "I am pleased with you, O ten-headed one."
'13': '"Quickly choose a boon, O knower of dharma, whatever you desire. What wish of yours shall I fulfill today? Your effort shall not be in vain."'
'14': Then, with an elated heart, Rāvaṇa, bowing his head to the god, spoke with a voice choked with joy.
'15': '"O Lord, there is no fear for living beings except from death. There is no enemy like death. I choose immortality."'
'16': Thus addressed, Brahmā said to Rāvaṇa, "Immortality is not possible for you. Choose another boon from me."
'17': Thus addressed by Brahmā, the creator of the worlds, Rāvaṇa, with folded hands, spoke these words in front of him.
'18': '"Let me be invincible to the Suparṇas, Nāgas, Yakṣas, Daityas, Dānavas, Rākṣasas, and the gods, O lord of creatures."'
'19': '"I have no concern for other beings, O worshipped by the gods. I consider beings like humans and others as mere grass."'
'20': Thus addressed by the righteous Rāvaṇa, the god, along with the gods, spoke to him.
'21': '"So be it, O foremost of Rākṣasas," said Brahmā to Rāvaṇa, and then he spoke again, "Listen to another boon, pleasing to me."'
'22': '"The heads you previously offered into the fire, O sinless one, will be restored to you, O Rākṣasa."'
'23': '"I grant you another boon, difficult to obtain, O gentle one. Your form will be as you desire in your mind."'
'24': Thus, the heads offered into the fire by Rāvaṇa, the Rākṣasa, were restored by the words of Brahmā.
'25': Having spoken thus to Rāvaṇa, Brahmā then addressed Vibhīṣaṇa, the righteous soul.
'26': '"Vibhīṣaṇa, I am pleased with you, O child, for your mind is set on dharma. Choose a boon, O virtuous one."'
'27': Vibhīṣaṇa, the righteous soul, with folded hands, spoke these words, endowed with all virtues, like the moon with its rays.
'28': '"O Lord, I am fulfilled, for the teacher of the world is pleased with me. If a boon is to be given, hear my wish, O virtuous one."'
'29': '"Even in the greatest calamity, may my mind be set on dharma. May the Brahmāstra, though unlearned, be known to me."'
'30': '"Whatever intellect arises in me, in whichever hermitage, may it be righteous, and may I uphold that dharma."'
'31': '"This is the supreme boon I consider, for nothing is difficult to obtain in the world for those devoted to dharma."'
'32': Again, pleased, Prajāpati spoke to Vibhīṣaṇa, "You are righteous, O child, and so it shall be."
'33': '"Since you are born in the Rākṣasa race, O destroyer of foes, and your intellect does not incline towards adharma, I grant you immortality."'
'34': Having said this, he was about to grant a boon to Kumbhakarṇa, when all the gods, with folded hands, spoke to Prajāpati.
'35': '"Do not grant a boon to Kumbhakarṇa, for you know how this evil-minded one terrifies the worlds."'
'36': '"In Nandana, he devoured seven Apsarās and ten followers of Mahendra, as well as sages and humans."'
'37': '"If this Rākṣasa, who has not yet received a boon, is granted one, he would devour the three worlds."'
'38': '"Under the pretext of a boon, grant him delusion, O one of boundless splendor, so that the worlds may be at peace and he may be subdued."'
'39': Thus addressed by the gods, Brahmā, born of the lotus, contemplated, and the goddess Sarasvatī appeared by his side.
'40': With folded hands, she stood by his side and spoke, "I have come, O god, what shall I do?"
'41': Prajāpati spoke to Sarasvatī, who had arrived, "O goddess, become the speech desired by the lord of Rākṣasas."
'42': Having said so, she entered, and then Prajāpati spoke, "Kumbhakarṇa, O mighty-armed one, choose the boon you desire."
'43': Hearing those words, Kumbhakarṇa spoke, "I desire to sleep for many years, O lord of gods."
'44': '"So be it," said Brahmā, and departed with the gods, and the goddess Sarasvatī left the Rākṣasa.'
'45': When the gods, along with Brahmā, had gone to the sky, he was freed from Sarasvatī and regained his own consciousness.
'46': Kumbhakarṇa, the wicked soul, thought with sorrow, "What kind of words have fallen from my mouth today?"
'-1': '"I think I was deluded by the gods who had come then." Thus, having obtained boons, all the brothers, with blazing splendor, went to the Śleṣmātaka forest and lived there happily.'
