'1': Thus, as he gazed upon the forest adorned with blossoming trees, searching for Vaidehi, the night came to an end.
'2': He heard the sacred chants of the Brahmins, who were well-versed in the six branches of the Vedas and performers of great sacrifices, during the night of the Brahma Rakshasas.
'3': Then, with auspicious musical instruments producing sounds delightful to the ears and mind, the mighty-armed and immensely powerful Ravana was awakened.
'4': Upon awakening, the illustrious and valiant king of the Rakshasas, adorned with disheveled garlands and garments, began to contemplate Vaidehi.
'5': Intensely overwhelmed by passion and intoxicated with desire, the Rakshasa could not conceal his longing within himself.
'6': Adorned with all kinds of ornaments, he shone with unparalleled splendor, as he entered the grove filled with various trees bearing flowers and fruits.
'7': Surrounded by ponds adorned with diverse flowers, always resonating with the melodious songs of intoxicated birds, it was a wondrous sight.
'8': Filled with various enchanting animals, pleasing to the eyes, he beheld the pathways adorned with arches of gems and gold.
'9': Teeming with groups of various animals and covered with fallen fruits, he entered the Ashoka grove, dense with trees.
'10': A hundred women, like the celestial nymphs following Mahendra, accompanied him as he proceeded, resembling the son of Pulastya.
'11': Some women there held golden lamps, while others carried fans made of yak tails and palm leaves.
'12': Carrying golden vessels filled with water, they went ahead, while others followed behind, holding circular fans and seats.
'13': One woman, with her right hand, held a radiant vessel made of jewels, filled with a sparkling drink.
'14': Another followed behind, holding a parasol resembling a royal swan, with a golden handle, shining like the full moon.
'15': The noble women of Ravana, with eyes overcome by sleep and intoxication, followed their heroic lord like lightning following a cloud.
'16': With disheveled necklaces and armlets, their complexions slightly altered, their hair loosened, and faces perspiring, they appeared charming.
'17': Swaying due to the remnants of intoxication and sleep, their beautiful faces adorned with flowers, their hair disheveled, they followed him.
'18': The women with intoxicated eyes, out of respect and love, followed their beloved husband, the lord of the Rakshasas.
'19': The mighty lord, subjugated by desire, appeared slow and languid, his mind captivated by Sita.
'20': Then, the son of the wind-god, Hanuman, heard the jingling of girdles and the tinkling of anklets of the supreme women.
'21': Hanuman, the monkey, saw him, the one with incomparable deeds, unimaginable strength, and valor, arriving at the entrance.
'22': Illuminated all around by numerous lamps, anointed with fragrant oil, they were held in front of him.
'23': Filled with the pride of desire and intoxication, his eyes were crooked and reddish, like Kamadeva without his bow.
'24': Wearing a garment resembling the foam of churned nectar, adorned with flowers, it was entangled with his bracelet.
'25': Concealed amidst the leaves of a tree, covered with hundreds of leaves and flowers, he approached to observe closely.
'26': Then, the great monkey saw the beautiful women of Ravana, endowed with beauty and youth.
'27': Surrounded by those lovely women, the illustrious king entered the pleasure grove, resounding with the cries of animals and birds.
'28': Intoxicated, adorned with exquisite ornaments, with ears like conch shells, the mighty son of Vishrava, the lord of the Rakshasas, was seen.
'29': Surrounded by supreme women, like the moon surrounded by stars, the great monkey beheld the radiant Ravana.
'30': Thinking, 'This is the mighty-armed Ravana,' the monkey realized, 'This is the one who lay in the best house in the city before.'
'31': Even though his fierce radiance was overwhelming, the wise Hanuman, concealed within the leaves, remained hidden.
'32': Desiring to see her with dark eyes, beautiful hips, and well-formed breasts, Ravana turned back.
'-1': Thus ends the eighteenth chapter named 'The Coming of Ravana' in the Sundara Kanda of the glorious Ramayana of Valmiki, the first epic.
