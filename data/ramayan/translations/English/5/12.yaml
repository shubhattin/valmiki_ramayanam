'0': Thus begins the twelfth chapter, called ‘Hanumadviṣāda’, in the Sundara Kanda of the revered Valmiki Ramayana.
'1': Situated in the midst of the palace, he resided among chambers adorned with creepers, in exquisite picture galleries and nocturnal abodes; and then he proceeded in search of Sita, eager to behold her divine countenance, yet her fair form eluded his gaze.
'2': Deep in contemplation, the mighty monkey beheld the beloved consort of Raghunanda, and with firm conviction he declared that Sita was not being securely held, for as I remain deprived of her sight, so she is left unguarded, O Maithilī.
'3': That virtuous daughter of Janaka—exemplary in self-control and revered even amid the ranks of demons—was, by means of an iniquitous act on the destined path, doomed to be struck down by the forces of wickedness.
'4': Upon beholding the hideous, deformed, and grotesquely distorted visages—long and terrifying in appearance—of the demon host, the daughter of Janaka, beloved of her father, was overwhelmed by terror and lost in dread.
'5': Not having encountered Sita, the heroic monkey, with a heavy heart, abandoned his martial ardor and, accompanied by his band of vanaras, lingered for a long while; lamenting that no opportunity had arisen to approach Sugrīva, nor had any mighty vanara—armed with a keen and potent staff—come to his aid.
'6': He surveyed the entire inner city—witnessed even by the consort of Ravana—yet the virtuous Sita remained unseen, and all his exertions proved to be in vain.
'7': Then all the assembled vanaras inquired, 'Do you not all, who have journeyed together, now recount, O hero, what deed you have performed upon your arrival? Pray, tell us what has been accomplished by you.'
'8': In absence of her sight, what words can I offer? Nevertheless, at the turning of time I shall without fail devote my worship to the daughter of Janaka.
'9': What, then, can the venerable Jāmbavān and the noble Angada say? They too have crossed the ocean, and the entire host of vanaras has assembled.
'10': Unutterable indeed is that wealth—the primal source of supreme felicity; and in that very place I shall deliberate further, for no final decision has yet been reached.
'11': Verily, the ineffable force is ever the activator of all endeavors; whatever action any creature performs, it is through this prime mover that success is achieved.
'12': Hence, I shall now exert my utmost effort in that ineffable pursuit, and I will also recount the hidden realms—those territories carefully guarded under Ravana’s sway.
'13': There appeared wondrous chambers for the discharge of the airs, magnificent abodes of blossoms, splendid galleries adorned with art, and numerous playhouses constructed with exquisite design.
'14': Moreover, there were various aerial vehicles, chariots without wheels, and all manner of conveyances; contemplating these marvels, he resolved to further investigate their details.
'15': There also existed earth-dwellings, temple abodes, and even structures adjoining one another—some of which seemed to arise and descend, while others remained fixed yet intermittently shifted from one place to another.
'16': He proceeded to unbar the doors and flung open the shutters, causing them to fall as if by the act of entering and descending; as if emerging and vanishing in a continual dance of arrival and departure.
'17': The mighty monkey meticulously examined every opening available—even a passage scarcely as wide as four finger-breadths—which he discovered within the inner citadel of Ravana’s domain.
'18': He then scrutinized all the passageways and adjoining streets, the vedikās and temple abodes, as well as the dwellings of the Śvabhra and those near the Puṣkarī; all these he observed with a keen and discerning eye.
'19': In his survey, he observed the demons in diverse and repulsive forms—hideous, deformed, and aberrant; yet although Hanuman beheld these monstrous figures, none bore the semblance of Janakātmja, the daughter of Janaka.
'20': Among the women of the world, unrivaled in beauty and endowed with supreme wisdom, one such form was seen by Hanuman; but it was not that beloved consort of Raghunanda he sought.
'21': The maiden of the serpents, radiant as the full moon in her grace, was also observed by Hanuman; yet she, too, was not the daughter of Janaka.
'22': Likewise, the powerful demon chief, accompanied by a serpent maiden upheld by mighty strength, was discerned by Hanuman; however, she was not the one who brings joy to Janaka.
'23': Then the mighty-armed hero beheld other noble women of distinguished birth, and with a fierce, penetrating look, Hanuman—the son of the wind—observed them intently.
'24': Amid the energetic endeavors of the vanara chieftains and the surging motions of the ocean, yet to no avail, the wind-born hero, after observing in dismay, sank once again into deep contemplation.
'25': Having soared in an aerial chariot, Hanuman, the illustrious son of the wind, found himself overcome by sorrow, his mind beset with profound grief.
'-1': Thus concludes the twelfth chapter, known as ‘Hanumadviṣāda’, in the Sundara Kanda of the revered Adikavi Valmiki’s Ramayana.
