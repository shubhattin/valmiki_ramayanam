'0': Thus begins the first chapter of the Sundarakanda in the glorious Ramayana composed by sage Valmiki, titled "Crossing the Ocean."
'1': Then Hanuman, the enemy of foes, sought to find the path trodden by the celestial beings, to reach the place where Sita, abducted by Ravana, was held.
'2': Desiring to perform a task that was unparalleled and difficult, the Vanara, with his head and neck raised high, appeared like the lord of cows.
'3': Then the mighty Hanuman, with a calm mind, roamed freely over the verdant meadows that resembled the color of beryl.
'4': Scaring the birds and uprooting trees with his chest, and slaying many deer, he moved like a lion in its prime.
'5': The mountain was adorned with pure minerals of natural hues like blue, red, and white, and was decorated with various colors.
'6': It was inhabited by celestial beings like Yakshas, Kinnaras, and Gandharvas, who were accompanied by their retinues, appearing like gods.
'7': Standing at the base of that great mountain, which was like a thousand elephants, the best of monkeys appeared like a serpent in a lake.
'8': Offering salutations to the Sun, Indra, the Wind, and Brahma, and to all beings, he made up his mind to proceed.
'9': Facing east, he offered salutations to the Wind and his own progenitor, and then prepared to proceed southward.
'10': Observed by the foremost of monkeys, Hanuman, determined to leap, grew in size for the prosperity of Rama, like the ocean during a full moon.
'11': With his body of immeasurable size, he pressed the mountain with his arms and feet, intending to leap across the ocean.
'12': The mountain, pressed by the monkey, shook for a moment, and all the flowers from the blossoming trees fell down.
'13': Covered all around by the fragrant shower of flowers released by the trees, the mountain appeared as if it was made of flowers.
'14': Pressed by the mighty Hanuman, the mountain released water like a rutting elephant.
'15': Pressed by the powerful Hanuman, the mountain released streams of golden and silver minerals.
'16': The mountain released large rocks, which appeared like a fire with its middle flame, as they were covered with dust.
'17': The beings residing in the caves, pressed by the mighty Hanuman, cried out with strange sounds.
'18': The great sound produced by the beings due to the pressure on the mountain filled the earth, the directions, and the groves.
'19': The serpents with broad heads, marked with auspicious signs, spewed fierce fire and bit the rocks with their teeth.
'20': The rocks, bitten by the angry serpents with poison, blazed with fire and broke into thousands of pieces.
'21': The herbs growing on that mountain, though capable of counteracting poison, could not neutralize the poison of the serpents.
'22': Thinking that the mountain was being broken by beings, the frightened Vidyadharas, along with their women, flew away from there.
'23': Leaving behind the golden vessels filled with wine, the precious utensils, and the golden goblets, they fled.
'24': Leaving behind various delicacies, meats, and the skins of bulls, as well as swords with golden hilts, they fled.
'25': Adorned with necklaces, intoxicated, wearing red garlands and ointments, with red eyes and lotus-like eyes, they took to the sky.
'26': The women, adorned with necklaces, anklets, armlets, and other ornaments, stood amazed and smiling in the sky with their lovers.
'27': The great sages among the Vidyadharas, displaying their great knowledge, stood together in the sky and gazed at the mountain.
'28': They heard the sound of the sages with purified souls, the Charanas, and the Siddhas, standing in the clear sky.
'29': This Hanuman, resembling a mountain, the son of the Wind, with great speed, intends to cross the ocean, the abode of Varuna.
'30': Desiring to perform a difficult task for the sake of Rama and the Vanaras, he wishes to reach the other shore of the ocean, which is hard to attain.
'31': Hearing the words of the Vidyadharas, the sages, they saw the immeasurable Hanuman on the mountain.
'32': He shook his body and trembled like a fire, and roared a great roar like a mighty cloud.
'33': His tail, covered with hair, moved in sequence like a serpent king, as he prepared to leap.
'34': His tail, coiled with great speed, appeared like a great serpent being carried by Garuda.
'35': He steadied his arms, resembling great iron clubs, and placed his feet on his waist.
'36': Gathering his arms and neck, the glorious Hanuman, full of energy, entered into his strength, courage, and valor.
'37': Looking at the path from afar, with his eyes directed upwards, he controlled his breath in his heart, gazing at the sky.
'38': Firmly placing his feet, the elephant among monkeys, Hanuman, with great strength, prepared to leap.
'39': 'The best of monkeys, Hanuman, spoke these words to the Vanaras: "As an arrow released by Rama, with the speed of the wind,'
'40': I shall go to Lanka, ruled by Ravana. If I do not see Sita in Lanka, the daughter of Janaka,
'41': I shall go to the abode of the gods with this very speed, if I do not see Sita in the heavenly realm, having made my effort in vain.
'42': I shall bind the king of the Rakshasas, Ravana, and bring him here. In every way, having accomplished my task, I shall return with Sita.
'43': Or I shall uproot Lanka along with Ravana and bring it here." Thus spoke Hanuman, the best of monkeys.
'44': Then, with great speed, without hesitation, he leaped, considering himself like Garuda.
'45': As he leaped with speed, the trees on the mountain, having gathered their branches, leaped all around.
'46': Carrying the trees with flowers, with great speed, he went into the clear sky.
'47': The trees, uprooted by his thigh's speed, followed the monkey for a moment, like relatives following a departing kinsman on a long journey.
'48': The Sala and other great trees, uprooted by Hanuman's thigh's speed, followed him like an army following a king.
'49': Accompanied by many trees with blossoming tops, Hanuman, resembling a mountain, appeared wondrous to behold.
'50': The trees with roots, then, sank into the salt water, as if in fear of the great Indra, in the abode of Varuna.
'51': Covered with various flowers and sprouts, the monkey, resembling a cloud, shone like a mountain with fireflies.
'52': The trees, having released their flowers due to his speed, scattered in the water, like friends returning after a departure.
'53': The various flowers, carried by the wind of the monkey, fell into the ocean, appearing like the sky adorned with stars.
'54': Covered with the fragrant and multicolored flowers, the monkey shone like a rising cloud adorned with lightning.
'55': The water, covered with flowers produced by his speed, appeared like the sky adorned with stars and the moon.
'56': His arms, extended in the sky, appeared like two five-headed serpents emerging from the mountain top.
'57': He appeared as if drinking the ocean's waves, and as if desiring to drink the sky, the great monkey was seen.
'58': His eyes, resembling the brilliance of lightning, following the path of the wind, shone like two fires on a mountain.
'59': His large, round eyes, with reddish pupils, shone like the sun and the moon.
'60': His face, with a coppery nose, appeared like the sun's orb touched by the evening.
'61': His tail, coiled, shone like the banner of Indra in the sky, as he leaped.
'62': Hanuman, with a tail like a wheel, with white teeth, the son of the Wind, shone like the sun with its halo.
'63': His large, coppery buttocks shone like a mountain with a large red mineral.
'64': The wind, passing through his body, roared like a cloud, as he leaped over the ocean.
'65': As a meteor falls from the northern direction, with its tail, so did the monkey appear.
'66': The monkey, resembling a falling sun, shone like a great elephant bound by a chain.
'67': With his body and shadow submerged, the monkey appeared like a boat in the ocean, driven by the wind.
'68': Wherever the great monkey went over the ocean, it appeared as if the ocean was agitated by his body's speed.
'69': The great monkey, with immense speed, leaped over the ocean's waves, resembling mountain peaks.
'70': The wind of the monkey and the wind of the clouds shook the ocean with its terrible roar.
'71': Dragging the great waves in the salt water, the tiger among monkeys leaped, as if scattering the two worlds.
'72': The great speed of the monkey crossed the waves of the great ocean, resembling Meru and Mandara mountains.
'73': The water, agitated by his speed, appeared like the sky covered with autumn clouds.
'74': The fish, crocodiles, and turtles were seen exposed, like bodies of beings with their clothes removed.
'75': Seeing the monkey crossing, the serpents in the ocean thought of him as Garuda.
'76': The shadow of the lion among monkeys, ten yojanas wide and thirty yojanas long, was beautiful.
'77': His shadow, following him, shone like a line of white clouds in the sky, as it fell on the salt water.
'78': The great monkey, with immense energy, appeared like a mountain with wings in the path of the wind.
'79': Where the powerful monkey went with speed, the ocean appeared as if it was made into a trough.
'80': As the king of birds approaches a flock of birds, Hanuman, like the wind, dragged the clouds.
'81': The great clouds, dragged by the monkey, appeared in colors of white, red, and blue.
'82': Entering and exiting the clouds repeatedly, he appeared like the moon, sometimes hidden and sometimes visible.
'83': Seeing the swift monkey leaping, the gods, Gandharvas, and Charanas showered flowers there.
'84': The sun did not scorch the leaping lord of monkeys, and the wind served him for the accomplishment of Rama's task.
'85': The sages praised him as he leaped through the sky, and the gods and Gandharvas sang, praising the lord of the forest.
'86': The Nagas, Yakshas, and various Rakshasas praised him, seeing the best of monkeys, suddenly free from fatigue.
'87': As the tiger among monkeys, Hanuman, leaped, the ocean, desiring the honor of the Ikshvaku lineage, thought.
'88': If I do not assist the lord of monkeys, Hanuman, I shall be blamed by all who speak.
'89': I was nurtured by the Ikshvaku king, Sagara, and this one is a minister of the Ikshvaku lineage; he should not be hindered.
'90': I must arrange for the monkey to rest, so that, having rested on me, he may cross over comfortably.
'91': Having made this noble decision, the ocean spoke to Mainaka, the best of mountains, hidden in the water.
'92': You were placed here by the great Indra as a barrier for the Asuras dwelling in the netherworld.
'93': You stand at the door of the immeasurable netherworld, knowing the strength of these beings who will rise again.
'94': You have the power to grow in all directions, O mountain; therefore, I urge you to rise, O best of mountains.
'95': This tiger among monkeys, Hanuman, with great strength, leaping for Rama's cause, is coming over you.
'96': I must assist him, who belongs to the Ikshvaku lineage; the Ikshvakus are revered by me and are most revered by you.
'97': Assist us, for our task should not be neglected; an unaccomplished task causes anger among the virtuous.
'98': Rise above the water, and let this monkey rest on you; he is our guest and the best among those who leap.
'99': O mountain with a golden navel, served by gods and Gandharvas, Hanuman, having rested on you, will proceed further.
'100': Considering the compassion of Kakutstha and the exile of Maithili, and the fatigue of the lord of monkeys, you should rise.
'101': Hearing the ocean's words, Mainaka, covered with great trees and creepers, quickly rose from the water.
'102': Breaking through the ocean's water, he rose high, like the sun breaking through a cloud.
'103': The great mountain, covered with water, showed its peaks, placed by the ocean.
'104': With peaks of gold, inhabited by Kinnaras and great serpents, resembling the rising sun, it seemed to pierce the sky.
'105': With peaks of gold, the mountain's peaks, rising, made the sky appear like a golden weapon.
'106': With peaks of gold, shining brightly, resembling a hundred suns, the best of mountains appeared.
'107': Rising without obstruction, Hanuman stood before it, thinking it was an obstacle in the middle of the ocean.
'108': The great monkey, with immense speed, struck the mountain with his chest, like the wind striking a cloud.
'109': The mountain, struck by the monkey, knowing the monkey's speed, rejoiced and roared.
'110': Standing in the sky, the delighted mountain, with a joyful heart, spoke to the monkey.
'111': Assuming a human form, standing on its peak, it said, "You have performed a difficult task, O best of monkeys.
'112': Rest comfortably on my peaks and then proceed; the ocean, nurtured by those born in the lineage of Raghu, honors you.
'113': The ocean, engaged in Rama's welfare, honors you; it is the eternal duty to reciprocate a favor.
'114': Desiring to reciprocate, he deserves respect from you; I have been urged by him out of great respect for you.
'115': Having leaped a hundred yojanas, let the monkey rest on your peaks and then proceed further.
'116': Rest on me, O tiger among monkeys, and then proceed; here are fragrant, sweet roots, and fruits in abundance.
'117': Having tasted them, O best of monkeys, rest and then proceed; there is also a connection between us, O chief of monkeys, known in the three worlds for your great qualities.
'118': Among the swift and leaping monkeys, O son of the Wind, I consider you the foremost, O elephant among monkeys.
'119': Even an ordinary guest deserves respect from one who knows the law; how much more so one like you.
'120': You are the son of the great god, the Wind, and you are like him in speed, O elephant among monkeys.
'121': When you, the knower of dharma, are honored, the Wind receives honor; therefore, you are worthy of my respect, and listen to the reason.
'122': In the Krita Yuga, O dear one, the mountains had wings and flew in all directions like Garudas.
'123': When they flew, the gods, along with the sages, and all beings were afraid of their falling.
'124': Then the thousand-eyed Indra, angry, cut off the wings of the mountains with his thunderbolt, thousands of times.
'125': The king of the gods, angry, approached me with his thunderbolt raised, and I was thrown by the great Wind.
'126': Thrown into this salt water, O best of monkeys, I was protected by your father, with my wings intact.
'127': Therefore, I honor you, O son of the Wind; you are worthy of my respect, and there is a great connection between us.
'128': In this matter concerning the ocean and myself, you should, with a joyful heart, grant me your favor, O wise one.
'129': Relieve your fatigue and accept my hospitality, O best of monkeys; I am pleased with your sight.
'130': 'Thus addressed, the best of monkeys spoke to the great mountain: "I am pleased, your hospitality is accepted, let this anger be removed.'
'131': The time for my task is pressing, and the day is passing; I have given my word not to stay here in between.
'132': Having said this, the foremost of monkeys, touching the mountain with his hand, entered the sky, smiling.
'133': Honored by the mountain and the ocean, with great respect, and blessed with auspicious words, he was praised.
'134': Then, having gone far above, leaving the mountain and the great ocean, he reached the path of his father in the clear sky.
'135': Having attained a higher path, looking at the mountain, the son of the Wind, unsupported, proceeded, the elephant among monkeys.
'136': Seeing the second difficult task of Hanuman, all the gods and the Siddhas praised him.
'137': The gods, delighted by his deed, stood there, and the thousand-eyed Indra, the lord of the gods, was pleased.
'138': The wise Indra, with a voice choked with emotion, spoke to the golden-peaked mountain, Sunabha.
'139': O golden-peaked mountain, I am greatly pleased with you; I grant you safety, go peacefully as you wish.
'140': You have done a great service by allowing Hanuman to rest, leaping a hundred yojanas without fear, despite the danger.
'141': This monkey goes for the welfare of Rama, the son of Dasaratha; I am greatly pleased with your hospitality.
'142': The best of mountains, seeing the lord of the gods, Indra, pleased, felt great joy.
'143': The mountain, granted a boon, stood firm, and Hanuman, in a moment, crossed the ocean.
'144': Then the gods, along with the Gandharvas, Siddhas, and great sages, spoke to Surasa, the mother of serpents, shining like the sun.
'145': This glorious son of the Wind, Hanuman, is leaping over the ocean; you should create an obstacle for him for a moment.
'146': Assuming a terrible form like a mountain, with a dreadful face and sharp teeth, make your mouth touch the sky.
'147': We wish to know his strength and further prowess; he will either overcome you by strategy or fall into despair.
'148': Thus addressed by the gods, the goddess Surasa, honored by them, assumed a Rakshasa form in the middle of the ocean.
'149': Terrifying and deformed, causing fear to all, she blocked the path of the leaping Hanuman and spoke.
'150': You have been designated as my food by the gods, O best of monkeys; I shall devour you, enter my mouth.
'151': This boon was given to me by Brahma, and she stood with her mouth wide open before the son of the Wind.
'152': 'Thus addressed by Surasa, Hanuman, with a delighted face, spoke: "Rama, the son of Dasaratha, has entered the Dandaka forest.'
'153': His wife, Sita, was abducted by Ravana, and I am going as a messenger on Rama's command.
'154': You should assist Rama, who resides in your domain, or after seeing Maithili and Rama, I shall enter your mouth, I promise you.
'155': Thus addressed by Hanuman, Surasa, capable of assuming any form, said, "No one can surpass me, this is my boon.
'156': Seeing him proceeding, Surasa spoke, desiring to know Hanuman's strength, "Enter my mouth today, O best of monkeys.
'157': This boon was given to me by Brahma, and she stood with her mouth wide open before the son of the Wind.
'158': 'Thus addressed by Surasa, the angry Hanuman spoke: "Make your mouth such that you can swallow me."'
'159': Thus addressed by Surasa, the angry Hanuman became ten yojanas wide.
'160': Seeing him resembling a cloud, ten yojanas wide, Surasa made her mouth twenty yojanas wide.
'161': Then Hanuman, angry, became thirty yojanas wide, and Surasa made her mouth forty yojanas wide.
'162': The heroic Hanuman became fifty yojanas high, and Surasa made her mouth sixty yojanas high.
'163': Then the heroic Hanuman became seventy yojanas high, and Surasa made her mouth eighty yojanas high.
'164': Hanuman, resembling fire, became ninety yojanas high, and Surasa made her mouth a hundred yojanas wide.
'165': Seeing her mouth wide open, the wise son of the Wind, Hanuman, resembling a cloud, thought.
'166': Compressing his body like a cloud, Hanuman, in a moment, became the size of a thumb.
'167': Then he entered her mouth and emerged, standing in the sky, the glorious one spoke.
'168': I have entered your mouth, O daughter of Daksha, salutations to you; I shall go where Vaidehi is, your boon is fulfilled.
'169': Seeing him released from her mouth, like the moon from Rahu's mouth, Surasa, in her own form, spoke to the monkey.
'170': For the accomplishment of your purpose, O best of monkeys, go peacefully and bring Vaidehi to the great Rama.
'171': Seeing the third difficult task of Hanuman, the beings praised the monkey, saying, "Well done, well done."
'172': Approaching the invincible ocean, the abode of Varuna, he entered the sky with speed, like Garuda.
'173': Adorned with rain-bearing clouds, frequented by birds, and traversed by the teachers of the Kaishika school, and frequented by Airavata.
'174': Adorned with lions, elephants, tigers, birds, serpents, and vehicles, and with flying chariots, it was splendid.
'175': Adorned with fires, resembling the touch of thunderbolts, it was inhabited by those who had performed great penances and conquered heaven.
'176': Carrying the oblations, served by the sun, adorned with planets, stars, the moon, and the sun, it was splendid.
'177': Filled with great sages, Gandharvas, Nagas, and Yakshas, it was pure and clear, frequented by the Visvavasus.
'178': Occupied by the elephant of the king of the gods, in the path of the moon and the sun, it was auspicious.
'179': In the canopy of the world, created by Brahma, frequented by the Vidyadharas, it was splendid.
'180': Hanuman, like Garuda, went in the path of the wind, dragging the clouds.
'181': The great clouds, dragged by the monkey, appeared in colors of white, red, and blue.
'182': Entering and exiting the clouds repeatedly, he appeared like the moon, sometimes hidden and sometimes visible.
'183': Like the autumn moon, he shone, entering and exiting, visible everywhere, Hanuman, the son of the Wind.
'184': He entered the unsupported sky, like a mountain with wings, and the Rakshasi named Simhika saw him.
'185': The Rakshasi, capable of assuming any form, thought, "Today, after a long time, I shall have a great meal."
'186': This great being has come under my control after a long time, she thought, and seized his shadow.
'187': As his shadow was seized, the monkey thought, "I am suddenly seized, my strength paralyzed."
'188': Like a great ship in the ocean against the wind, he looked in all directions, up and down.
'189': He saw the great being rising from the salt water, and seeing it, the son of the Wind thought.
'190': As described by the king of monkeys, this is the wondrous being that seizes shadows, there is no doubt.
'191': Knowing the truth of the matter, the wise monkey grew in size, like a cloud in the rainy season.
'192': Seeing the body of the great monkey growing, she opened her mouth, resembling the netherworld and the sky.
'193': Roaring like a cloud, she rushed at the monkey, and he saw her great deformed mouth.
'194': The wise monkey, with a body like a thunderbolt, saw her deformed mouth and her vital points.
'195': Compressing his body, the great monkey fell into her mouth, and the Siddhas and Charanas saw him sinking.
'196': Like the full moon being swallowed by Rahu, he was seen, and then the monkey, with sharp nails, tore her vital points.
'197': Then, with the speed of thought, he leaped out, and with skill and courage, he struck her down.
'198': The heroic monkey, with speed, grew again, and having struck her down, he fell into the water.
'199': Seeing the Rakshasi slain by the monkey, the beings in the sky spoke to the best of monkeys.
'200': You have performed a great deed today, having slain a great being; accomplish your desired task without hindrance, O best of leapers.
'201': O lord of monkeys, one who possesses these four qualities like you—courage, vision, wisdom, and skill—does not fail in tasks.
'202': Honored by them, the honorable one, having achieved his purpose, entered the sky like Garuda, the eater of serpents.
'203': Having reached the farthest shore, he looked all around and saw a forest at the end of a hundred yojanas.
'204': The best of monkeys, descending, saw the island adorned with various trees and the groves of Malaya.
'205': He saw the ocean, the shores of the ocean, the trees growing on the shores, and the faces of the wives of the ocean.
'206': Seeing himself resembling a great cloud, blocking the sky, the wise one made a decision.
'207': Seeing my body's growth and speed, the Rakshasas might become curious about me, he thought.
'208': Then, compressing his body, resembling a mountain, he returned to his natural form, like one free from delusion.
'209': Compressing his form greatly, Hanuman returned to his natural state, like Vishnu, who took three steps to subdue Bali.
'210': Assuming various beautiful forms, he reached the other shore, which was impossible for others to reach, having examined himself and the situation.
'211': Then, reaching the summit of the mountain, resembling a great cloud, he descended on the peak of the mountain.
'212': Having reached the shore of the ocean, seeing Lanka on the mountain's peak, the monkey descended on the mountain, shaking his form, disturbing the animals and birds.
'213': Having crossed the ocean filled with Danavas and serpents, with great strength, he descended on the shore of the great ocean and saw Lanka, resembling Amaravati.
'-1': Thus ends the first chapter of the Sundarakanda in the glorious Ramayana composed by sage Valmiki, titled "Crossing the Ocean."
