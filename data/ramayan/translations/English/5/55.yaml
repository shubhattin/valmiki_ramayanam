'0': Now, in the illustrious Valmiki Ramayana, within the Sundara Kanda, begins the chapter entitled ‘Hanumadvivhrama’—the fifty‐fifth sarga—heralding events of great import.
'1': Surveying the city aglow with shimmering illumination and thronged by trembling hosts of armed protectors, the vanara Hanuman fixed his thoughtful gaze upon the city of Lanka.
'2': In that moment a tremendous dread and deep-seated fear overtook his heart; verily, it was by my own hand that the deed of setting Lanka afire was executed.
'3': Blessed indeed are those noble souls who, though anger may arise within their intellect, do not fan its flames—as wise men would not douse a blazing fire with water.
'4': He who is inflamed with wrath commits no sin; for who, even in anger, would dare to slay his preceptor? Moreover, one whose speech is harshly wrought by anger does not win the approbation of the virtuous.
'5': When a man is overcome by anger, he becomes heedless of both spoken and unspoken counsel; truly, for one so enraged no proper or fruitful action—spoken or otherwise—can be performed.
'6': But he who, noticing the surge of wrath within, immediately restrains it through forbearance, is esteemed as a noble man—comparable to a worn, threadbare garment yet dignified in his self-mastery.
'7': Then he censured me, accusing me of having an exceedingly weak intellect and shameless character, for in thoughtless haste I set Sita ablaze—a grievous act that inflicted harm upon her lord.
'8': ‘If indeed all are to be consumed by the flames, even the virtuous Janaki, then by that very act the deed of destroying her consort, which I unwittingly performed, remains concealed,’ thus was the lament.
'9': 'For it was with that very purpose in mind that I initiated the act: I did indeed set Lanka aflame, even as Sita was left without the shelter and protection she so rightly deserved.'
'10': Without a shred of doubt did I undertake this deed; and in the very blaze of my anger, the foundations of the enemy were thoroughly shattered.
'11': Yet Janaki is not seen to be utterly destroyed, for there exists a certain purpose—the entire city of Lanka has been reduced to mere ashes.
'12': Had I, owing to a lapse in judgment, executed that destructive deed, then even now the renunciation of life would have seemed to be my destined lot.
'13': ‘Why should I today fall into the flames?’ I exclaimed unto the one whose countenance is as steadfast as a venerable column; for here, I do bequeath my very body unto those destined to dwell in the great ocean.
'14': How then, O Lord Hari, can it be that I am seen alive? For those two resolute and stalwart men, whose might was unleashed in a single, sweeping act, have effected total annihilation.
'15': Indeed, by my own misdirected wrath and error was this deed brought forth, a deed that has since become renowned throughout the three worlds as having been accomplished by a vanara.
'16': Thereafter, the regal spirit within me was kindled anew; yet even by the grace of the Supreme, due to my passionate attachment, Sita was not duly safeguarded.
'17': In the ruin that befell Sita, both she and her consort were left utterly desolate—with their downfall so complete that even Sugriva, in his sorrow, forsook all familial ties.
'18': 'Upon hearing these words, Bharata—who cherished him as a brother—and the virtuous Shatrughna wondered in deep consternation: how can one possibly continue in life under such grievous circumstances?'
'19': For in the illustrious Ikshvaku dynasty, so firmly established in dharma, none can escape the impending ruin; henceforth, all the people shall suffer the pangs of sorrow and affliction.
'20': I, bereft of fortune and having forsaken the gathering of righteous wealth,—overborne by anger and ill-disposed nature—have, in unmistakable fashion, brought about a devastation that shakes the very world.
'21': Thus, reflecting upon these causes and the myriad omens and illustrious reasons now before me—confirmed by the words of the venerable rishis—I once again pondered over that which had been previously revealed.
'22': Then, the one of comely, all-limbed beauty was safeguarded by her own radiant energy; the auspicious one, untouched by the conflagration, continued to shine even amid the consuming fires.
'23': For the wife of that virtuous soul—imbued with immeasurable splendor and guarded by the purity of his character—is not one whom the fierce flame is allowed to touch.
'24': Surely, by the divine influence of Rama and the virtuous conduct of Vaidehi, it was not ordained that I should be burnt—such was not the destined course for me.
'25': O Goddess, adored by Rama and revered as the sister of Bharata and his brothers alike, by what means could you ever be consigned to destruction?
'26': For the all-pervading, eternal lord—whose presence is unassailable—does not set even my humble toes aflame; whence then could it be that the narrative concerning the noble is thus condemned?
'27': Then again, Hanuman, overcome with astonishment, paused in his contemplation while witnessing the magnificent spectacle upon the mountain of Hiranyanabha, displayed midst surging waters.
'28': By the austerity of ascetic penance, the unwavering truth of his speech, and his singular resolve towards his beloved, he did not let the consuming fire be abated—such flame did not diminish in its fervor.
'29': Thereupon, he again turned his reflective mind to the divine covenant of dharma conferred by the goddess, and in that very moment, he hearkened to the pronouncements of the illustrious sages among the exalted assemblies.
'30': Alas, what a most intractable deed was wrought by you, O Hanuman! You have unleashed a ferocious and dreadful conflagration—a searing fire as terrible and incisive as that of the mightiest of demons.
'31': The defenders, thrown into utter disarray and panic—women, children, and the elderly alike—lifted anguished cries, while even the mothers wailed in tumultuous despair.
'32': Thus, the city of Lanka, destined to be burnt, was seen in complete devastation; yet, in wondrous contrast, Janaki herself was not consumed by the flames—a marvel that left us all in deep astonishment.
'33': Hearing those immortal words, Hanuman’s heart was instantly filled with a joy as divine as ambrosia, his spirit enlivened by the celestial message.
'34': Owing to the auspicious portents, the witnessed events, the profound reasons and noble virtues, and the exalted pronouncements of the sages, Hanuman became all the more dear and beloved in spirit.
'35': Then the vanara, his heart swelling with the fulfillment of long-cherished desires, having beheld once more the radiant royal scion before him, resolutely determined to hasten his return.
'-1': Thus ends the chapter of ‘Hanumadvivhrama’—the fifty‐fifth sarga in the Sundara Kanda of the great, time-honoured Valmiki Ramayana, as the sacred narrative draws to its close.
