'0': Thus begins the thirty-sixth chapter of the Sundarakanda in the glorious Ramayana composed by sage Valmiki, titled 'The Offering of the Ring'.
'1': The mighty and radiant Hanuman, son of the wind god, spoke again with humility to instill confidence in Sita.
'2': O noble lady, I am a messenger of the wise Rama. Behold, O Devi, this ring marked with Rama's name.
'3': It has been brought to you as a token of assurance, given by the great soul himself. Be comforted, for your sorrows shall soon bear fruit.
'4': Taking the ornament of her lord in her hand, Sita gazed at it, feeling as if she had reunited with her husband, and was filled with joy.
'5': Her beautiful face, with eyes resembling red and white lotuses, shone with delight, like the moon freed from Rahu's grasp.
'6': Then, the modest young lady, delighted by the message from her husband, praised the great monkey for his deed.
'7': You are valiant, capable, and wise, O foremost of monkeys, for you alone have dared to invade the realm of the Rakshasas.
'8': The ocean, a hundred yojanas wide and the abode of sea creatures, was crossed by you with a leap that is worthy of praise.
'9': I do not consider you an ordinary monkey, O best of monkeys, for you have no fear even of Ravana, nor are you perturbed.
'10': O chief of monkeys, you deserve to be spoken to by me, if you have indeed been sent by Rama, the knower of self.
'11': Rama, who is difficult to overcome, would not send anyone to me without testing their valor, especially in my case.
'12': By good fortune, Rama, the righteous and true to his word, is well, as is the mighty Lakshmana, the joy of Sumitra.
'13': If the scion of the Kakutstha dynasty is well, why does he not, in his wrath, burn the earth girdled by the ocean, like the fire at the end of the age?
'14': Or perhaps those two, capable of subduing even the gods, are unable to reverse my misfortunes, I think.
'15': Is Rama not distressed, is he not tormented, and does he accomplish his tasks, O best of men?
'16': Is he not dejected, confused, or bewildered in his duties? Does the prince perform the tasks of a king?
'17': Does he employ the twofold and threefold strategies, and does he, the scorcher of foes, make friends with allies?
'18': Does he gain friends and is he approached by enemies? Is he surrounded by auspicious friends and honored by them?
'19': Does the prince seek the favor of the gods, and does he rely on both human effort and divine will?
'20': Has Rama not lost his affection for me, who is exiled? Will he rescue me from this distress?
'21': Accustomed to happiness and unaccustomed to sorrow, does Rama not succumb to grief after encountering this great sorrow?
'22': Is the welfare of Kausalya, Sumitra, and Bharata frequently heard of?
'23': On my account, does Rama, who deserves honor, not become absorbed in grief? Is he not distracted, and will he rescue me?
'24': Will Bharata, who loves his brothers, send a formidable army, guarded by ministers, for my sake?
'25': Will the illustrious Sugriva, lord of the monkeys, come for my sake, surrounded by heroic monkeys armed with teeth and nails?
'26': Will the valiant Lakshmana, the joy of Sumitra, destroy the Rakshasas with a shower of arrows?
'27': Will I soon see Ravana, along with his kin, slain in battle by Rama with his fierce weapon?
'28': Does that face, golden in hue and fragrant like a lotus, not wither in sorrow without me, like a lotus in the sun without water?
'29': Having renounced his kingdom and taken me to the forest on foot under the pretext of righteousness, does he maintain courage in his heart, free from fear and sorrow?
'30': Neither his mother, father, nor anyone else is dearer to him than me. I shall live, O messenger, until I hear news of my beloved.
'31': Thus, having spoken these meaningful and sweet words to the lord of monkeys, the Devi paused, eager to hear more of Rama's words.
'32': Hearing Sita's words, Hanuman, of immense valor, placed his hands on his head and spoke in reply.
'33': Rama, with eyes like lotuses, does not know that you are here, otherwise he would have brought you swiftly, like Indra bringing Shachi.
'34': Upon hearing my words, Rama will soon come, leading a great army of monkeys and bears.
'35': With a barrage of arrows, he will make the ocean, the abode of Varuna, impassable, and will subdue the city of Lanka, calming the Rakshasas.
'36': If death, gods, or great demons stand in Rama's path, he will slay them too.
'37': Filled with sorrow from not seeing you, O noble lady, Rama finds no peace, like an elephant tormented by a lion.
'38': I swear by Mandara, its roots and fruits, by Malaya, Vindhya, Meru, and Dardura.
'39': You shall see Rama's face, with beautiful eyes, charming lips, and lovely earrings, like the full moon risen.
'40': Soon, O Vaidehi, you shall see Rama on the Prasravana mountain, seated like Indra on the head of an elephant.
'41': Rama does not eat meat, nor does he drink honey. He always eats the fifth portion of well-prepared forest food.
'42': Rama does not remove mosquitoes, flies, insects, or reptiles from his body, as his mind is absorbed in thoughts of you.
'43': Rama is always engaged in meditation, always immersed in sorrow, thinking of nothing else, for he is overcome by desire.
'44': Rama, the best of men, is ever wakeful, and even when asleep, he utters the sweet words 'Sita' as he awakens.
'45': Seeing a fruit, flower, or anything else that pleases a woman's heart, he often sighs and says, 'O beloved,' addressing you.
'46': O Devi, the royal prince, ever devoted to his vow, constantly tormented, speaks only of you, saying 'O Sita,' and makes every effort for your sake.
'47': Thus, with her sorrow alleviated by the mention of Rama, and sharing Rama's sorrow, Sita, the daughter of Videha, shone like the autumn moon with a remaining cloud.
'-1': Thus ends the thirty-sixth chapter of the Sundarakanda in the glorious Ramayana composed by sage Valmiki, titled 'The Offering of the Ring'.
