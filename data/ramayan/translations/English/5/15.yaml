'0': Thus begins the fifteenth canto of the Sundara Kanda in the revered Valmiki Ramayana, entitled ‘Sītopalambha’.
'1': There, stationary in his place and steadfast on the path—gazed upon Maithilī, and by surveying the entire earth, sought her out with unwavering attention.
'2': She was adorned with delicate creepers and charming plants at her feet, all resplendently arrayed with a divine perfume and nectar that enhanced her every aspect.
'3': Like a delightful grove, she was encircled by gentle deer and melodious birds, her abode resembling a charming palace celebrated for the assemblage of tuneful cuckoos.
'4': Adorned with ornaments reminiscent of golden and lotus blossoms, and bedecked with elegant water-lily motifs, she was furnished with numerous couches and crowned with many earthly abodes.
'5': Her limbs were festooned with all manner of charming blossoms—like the fruitful boughs of trees—and her beauty radiated with a splendor comparable to the resplendent glow of the rising sun.
'6': There, the breeze—radiant as if alight with a divine flame—surveyed the scene, as though orchestrating the arrangement of branches, while birds flitted about as if fashioning a natural dwelling.
'7': Countless exquisite clusters of flowers, arranged from the very base by flower-laden roots, came together as agents that dispelled all melancholy and sorrow.
'8': The earth was gently caressed by the abundant weight of these blossoms—tender and resplendent—with delicate, petal-like flowers and charming buds, creating an enchanting carpet below.
'9': The entire region shone with a celestial effulgence, as if illumined from every direction, where trees bearing seven leaves stood alongside champaka and uddalaka, all manifesting sublime beauty.
'10': Many trees with well-rooted strength bloomed in splendid array, some resembling the majestic shataka-kumbha, while others glowed like tongues of radiant flame.
'11': Some shone with a hue reminiscent of blue kohl, their countless blossoms akin to sorrowless trees, evoking the famed Nandana garden and the magnificent chariot of Chaitra.
'12': It was endowed with an almost unfathomable, divine beauty—a richness of grace and splendor—while above, the heavens themselves appeared filled with a host of floral luminescence.
'13': Like an ocean in its fifth tier composed of a hundred varieties of sparkling flower-gems, the scene was ceaselessly embellished by floral treasures and imbued with the sweet fragrance of nectar from every plant.
'14': The garden resounded with a myriad of melodious tones, attended by herds of deer and groups of sages alike; the air was infused with a profusion of sacred, delightful fragrances.
'15': Her perfume was as potent as the musk of a mountain sovereign, and its secondary fragrance was peerless—so much so that even in the asoka grove, the chief of the monkey host made his presence known.
'16': He beheld, at a distance, a magnificent temple-like edifice; and within its midst stood a structure supported by a thousand pillars, reminiscent of the pristine, snowy peaks of Mount Kailāsa.
'17': There existed a flight of steps, fashioned of coral and set upon blazing golden platforms, which shone in the eyes like an ever-glowing, celestial brilliance.
'18': Her attire was pure and majestically fashioned, resembling the illustrious sky itself, yet beneath this resplendence she was veiled by attendants of a rakshasa order, clad in garments tainted by earthly impurity.
'19': Time and again, the ascetics—those who subsist on austere fasts and humble existence—gazed upon her during the bright phase of the moon, finding in her countenance a flawless, lunar line of immaculate radiance.
'20': Her form, modest yet famous for its soft allure, shone with an exquisite luminance; and her tresses, bound in a smoky network, rose like delicate crests of resplendent light.
'21': Clad in a single, graceful yellow garment and adorned with ornaments that evoked the splendor of a blooming lotus pond, she radiated a celestial magnificence.
'22': Afflicted and scorched by sorrow, wearied by her austere penances, she appeared as one tormented by the searing braziers of the very cosmos—her grief vividly expressed in every measure.
'23': Her face, brimming with tears and marked by a countenance of the downtrodden, bore the unmistakable imprint of one who is ever absorbed in meditation on lament and sorrow.
'24': She beheld her beloved people, just as the host of rakshasas did; and she herself was encircled by a retinue of subdued deer and hounds, as though swathed entirely in the care of her attendants.
'25': Stirred by the awe inspired by blue serpents and the enchanting strains of the flute—with blue waters cascading in a singular, mesmerizing flow—she appeared as the illustrious queen of the forest.
'26': He observed her—one deserving of felicity yet visibly tormented by grief and stricken by innumerable afflictions—with vast, sorrowful eyes that betrayed a countenance marred by despair.
'27': Then, moved by circumstances and fortified by reason derived from her very presence, he softly addressed her with a tenderness akin to that of a guardian cherishing his beloved.
'28': For she was seen in a form so perfect that she embodied beauty itself; her eyes, full and luminous as the moon, shone with a refined and graceful brilliance.
'29': All directions, suffused with divine radiance, testified to the goddess in her entirety; with her blue neck and a visage reminiscent of a perfect, radiant lotus, she was firmly established in the very center of all things.
'30': As one might cherish the beloved Sītā—with eyes like lotus petals and a charm rivaling that of the celestial god of love—so did the entire universe behold her, resplendent as a full moon.
'31': Upon the earth, amidst her devoted progeny, she appeared as a disciplined ascetic—though her labored, sorrowful breaths betrayed a pain akin to that of a vanquished serpent monarch.
'32': Her grief was woven into a vast tapestry of sorrow that seemed unworthy of regal bearing, and it was enshrouded in swirling, smoke-like designs that flickered like the crest of radiant flames.
'33': It was as though her cherished memories were shaken to the core, her abundance diminished, and her faith along with all she held dear utterly forsaken.
'34': As one bereft of companionship, with intellect and sagacity all but lost, her once illustrious fame appeared to have fallen, subdued by the sting of calumny.
'35': Beholding the pitiable Sītā—troubled by the onslaught of a demon host and appearing as feeble and trembling as a young fawn—he cast his gaze upon her with deep concern.
'36': Her form, imbued with the fullness of steam and water, bore a dark, curved countenance and slender arms; yet her face, devoid of a smile, repeatedly revealed a despondent mien.
'37': Among the downtrodden, she bore the marks of earthly stains yet was adorned in a manner most befitting of honor—her brilliance enveloped like clouds around the celestial sovereign of stars.
'38': In that very moment, as his discerning mind beheld Sītā with earnest inquiry, it seemed to falter—overwhelmed by the confluence of her grace and the tender allure of her presence.
'39': Saddened by grief, the valorous Hanuman beheld Sītā, whose expressions—diminished by the rigors of tradition—appeared as though they had lost their once-vibrant eloquence.
'40': Having looked upon the majestic-eyed princess, chastened by fate, he deliberated with care, addressing her gently as ‘O Sītā’, his reasoning shaped by the circumstances surrounding her.
'41': Then, extolling the virtues befitting Vaidehā herself, Rama celebrated her by adorning her with a dazzling network of jewels that enhanced the beauty of her form.
'42': Her earrings, her well-arranged hair, and perfectly formed eyebrows, accompanied by gems reminiscent of pearls and rubies festooning her hands, contributed to her resplendent adornment.
'43': Being of a dark, captivating complexion and harmoniously poised, these very attributes were the ones that Rama himself proudly proclaimed.
'44': In that realm, I observed not vehicles without proper support; rather, unquestionably, those that were well-borne and properly conveyed were present without a shadow of doubt.
'45': Her attire—a splendid garment woven of yellow and golden brocade—shone with auspicious beauty, and in the northern quarters it was seen embellished with delicate, floating adornments.
'46': Her ornaments, foremost among those visible upon the earth, were arrayed with singular excellence, joined in harmonious splendor by other illustrious jewels.
'47': Owing to its long-standing tradition, her robe appeared intricate and weighty, yet its hue and radiant brilliance remained ever sublime and resplendent.
'48': This very golden-complexioned lady, the adored consort of Rama, remains unvanquished in spirit—for her steadfast chastity is ever enshrined in his heart.
'49': She is the very one whom Rama extols in fourfold measure—through compassion, unwavering firmness, poignant sorrow, and the intoxication of deep, divine love.
'50': It is said that a woman may be lost through the weight of pity and desolation, and that a wife may be diminished by sorrow—even though she is dearly beloved and cherished in the raptures of love.
'51': This divine lady, resplendent in every limb and every facet in accordance with her true nature, perfectly mirrors Rama’s own likeness as witnessed by the discerning eye.
'52': In her heart and in her very being dwells an unwavering sense of dharma, such that even for a single moment a truly virtuous soul is sustained by its light.
'53': Though Rama was beset by severe trials and diminished by sorrow, he did not permit his divine self to languish; resolutely, he upheld his mortal frame against the tide of grief.
'54': Thus, upon beholding Sītā—the joyous, wind-born one—his heart swelled with elation, and in silent admiration he set forth, extolling the grandeur of Lord Rama in his innermost thoughts.
'-1': Thus concludes the fifteenth sarga, entitled ‘Sītopalambha’, in the Sundara Kanda of the revered Valmiki Ramayana, the ancient and sacred epic.
