'0': Thus begins the thirteenth section named ‘Hanuman Nirveda’ in the Sundara Kanda of the illustrious Valmiki Ramayana.
'1': Leaving the aerial chariot, the fleet-footed Hanuman advanced in a remarkable manner, his speed akin to lightning darting through dense clouds.
'2': Approaching Ravana’s abode, Hanuman, having not espied Janaki Sita, spoke his solemn message.
'3': O Sita, beloved of Rama whose beauty surpasses even the famed Lolitā of Lanka, I perceive not thy resplendent form adorned in every grace.
'4': Behold the banks like gentle embankments, the streams and rivers, the fringes of groves, the mouths of watercourses, and even the fortresses of the earth itself.
'5': Yet, though the whole earth lies adorned like Lolitā, I see no trace of Janaki; even as Sita is lodged in Ravana’s dwelling—the abode proclaimed by the sovereign of eagles—she remains unseen.
'6': Should not Sita, the Vaidehi, the Maithili, daughter of Janaka, be released from the bondage imposed by Ravana’s might?
'7': I believe that the demon who hastily set out to seize Sita shall soon be subdued by the fearsome volley of Rama’s arrows.
'8': Or perhaps, as she treads upon a path fortified by destiny, I deem that the tender heart of the dear lady may have been overwhelmed, as vast as the ocean in its sorrow.
'9': Afflicted by the rapid assault and by the force of Ravana’s arms, the lady with wide, sorrow-laden eyes appears to have been forsaken by life itself.
'10': Surely, having surged repeatedly as though like the rolling sea, Janaka’s daughter Sita is portrayed as having fallen into an ocean of despair.
'11': Alas! Though modest in virtue and endowed with self-restraint, Sita is being ravaged by Ravana, the austere ascetic, as though all bonds were being unbound.
'12': Or else, by the lecherous glances of the Rakshasa king’s consorts, driven by ignoble intent, she is destined to be consumed.
'13': With a face radiant like the full moon and eyes reminiscent of lotus leaves, as she meditates upon Rama, her countenance reflects a quintuple grace and charm.
'14': Alas! For Rama and Lakshmana—thus in Ayodhya, O Maithili—the beloved Vaidehi is lamented; her form, once adored, appears fated to be abandoned.
'15': Alternatively, I suspect that in Ravana’s taking her, the young maiden, confined as if in a cage, is overwhelmed by tears and deep dismay.
'16': O noble daughter of Janaka, the cherished consort of Rama, by what means can one with eyes like lotus leaves come under the sway of Ravana?
'17': Whether she be ruined, undone, or lifeless, Janaka’s daughter—the adored spouse of Rama—is not fit to be presented in such a plight.
'18': There may indeed be a reproach in exhibiting her in this condition; truly, the very idea of such a grievous duty weighs heavily upon my mind.
'19': In this very undertaking, lacking both the proper moment and leave for success, what can be achieved? Thus Hanuman further contemplated.
'20': If I proceed and yet fail to behold Sita in the city of the lord of monkeys, then what purpose shall my endeavor serve?
'21': For my act of overstepping these bounds would be as futile as the vast ocean itself; to enter Lanka and glimpse the demons is a venture unworthy of success.
'22': What then could Sugriva recount? Are these not the assembled hosts of vanaras, or even the two scions of Dasaratha who have reached Kishkindha?
'23': If I go to the distant abodes of Kākutstha and speak in stern terms, yet fail to set eyes upon Sita, then truly my life’s purpose would be rendered null.
'24': Hearing speech that is harsh, severe, and cruel—inflicting a burning torment upon the senses in regard to Sita—I shall no longer be present to witness it.
'25': Beholding one so hardened in resolve and inflamed in spirit, Lakshmana—the keen intellect and devoted warrior—shall not be appeased.
'26': Upon hearing of the ruin of his own brothers, even Bharata is destined to perish; and when Shatrughna sees Bharata lifeless, he too shall cease to exist.
'27': Having observed the demise of his sons, their mothers will be overcome with sorrow; there is no doubt that Kaushalya, Sumitra, and Kaikeyi shall share in this lamentation.
'28': Grateful and ever steadfast in truth, Sugriva—sovereign of the vanara hosts—upon beholding Rama, the blessed Tathagata, is instantly fortified and his life thereby affirmed.
'29': The distressed and sorrowing ascetic woman, bereft of delight and pained by the grief for her husband, is destined to be forsaken in life.
'30': And the queen, stricken with anguish and tormented by sorrow, even when beset by calamity’s touch, shall never again shine with the brilliance of the stars.
'31': Owing to the devastation of parental honor and compounded by the misfortunes of Sugriva, even the youthful Angada is fated to be vanquished in this life.
'32': Afflicted by the grief wrought by her consort, the denizens of the forest, with clenched fists, shall indeed smite her very head.
'33': Through the offering of solace, the honoring of her dignity, and by the deeds of the illustrious monkey-lord, the vanaras shall preserve their lives.
'34': Nor shall they indulge in playful frolic in the forests, on the mountains, or in barren lands; such recreations shall not be experienced by the assembly of monkeys and elephants.
'35': Those blessed with sons and daughters, and burdened by the sorrow of their husbands, shall fall from the heights of mountains and in every adverse locale.
'36': Be it in dire straits of conflict, in an onslaught of fierce flames, or even in the abandonment of fasts, the vanaras will take up arms and march forth.
'37': I deem that a dreadful tumult shall befall me; verily, the annihilation of the Ikshvaku dynasty and of the forest dwellers alike is foretold.
'38': Therefore, I shall not venture to Kishkindha, for I am unable to behold Sugriva in the absence of my dearest Maithili.
'39': Yet indeed, two noble and righteous charioteers approach me; with steadfast resolve, I shall support them, along with the fleet vanaras.
'40': Securing them by the hand, by the word, and as firmly as the roots of a tree, I shall proceed as a vanara, having beheld Janaka’s daughter.
'41': Resolved in my purpose and in a land teeming with yields like the fertile ocean, I shall set forth to behold the illustrious, deathless scion.
'42': Whether seated in earnest meditation or engaged in solemn duty, the warriors—with their spears and determined vows—shall ultimately dismember the foe.
'43': I too surmise that this outcome is ordained by the sages; I shall proceed with due care, and if I do not perceive her, then truly I shall behold Janaki.
'44': Resplendent in noble origins, bedecked with an illustrious garland of renown and celebrated virtues, for many a long night did I behold my Sita.
'45': With the austerity of penance, I shall remain as steadfast as the deeply rooted tree; I will not retreat after having gazed upon her with unwavering eyes.
'46': If, by any chance, I return and succeed in reclaiming Sita, then with Angada and all the vanaras my company will be complete.
'47': Many faults lead to destruction in mortal life, yet virtue begets prosperity; therefore, I shall resolutely preserve life, for the eternal assembly endures.
'48': Bearing manifold grief in his heart, the monkey of the vanara troop did not overreach the distant shore of sorrow.
'49': Then, summoning unparalleled valor, the brave vanara declared, “I shall slay Ravana—the ten-headed, mighty adversary—and restore Sita, whose beauty enkindles desire.”
'50': Or else, casting aside such vacillations altogether, I shall, like a noble beast of the lord of animals, procure for Rama that which is most dear.
'51': Thus, having concluded my deliberations regarding the retrieval of Sita, a vanara—his mind steeped in meditation and sorrow—settled into deep contemplation.
'52': Until I set my eyes upon Sita, the illustrious consort of Rama, I shall repeatedly scour the city of Lanka.
'53': With words declaring descent, I resolved to bring Rama forth; perceiving this, Raghava, upon seeing his consort, let loose a fierceness that overwhelmed all the vanaras.
'54': Herein I shall observe a regulated sustenance with my senses firmly in check, that no man or vanara may be lost through my inaction.
'55': And even the great Ashoka grove and the magnificent, towering tree shall be attained by me without a hint of hesitation.
'56': Having paid obeisance to Vasundhara, Rudra, as well as to Aditya, the Ashvins, and even to Marut, I shall proceed towards that demon who augments sorrow.
'57': After vanquishing the demons and the illustrious lady of the Ikshvaku clan, I will forthwith present unto Rama a success akin to that of an accomplished ascetic.
'58': Like a fleeting moment immersed in deep meditation, with his senses assembled in profound thought, the mighty-armed Hanuman—son of the wind—rose forth.
'59': Salutations to Rama, to Lakshmana, to the divine consort, and to that daughter of Janaka; salutations also to Rudra, Indra, Yama, and to the illustrious hosts of the Moon, Fire, and the thundering Maruts.
'60': Having thus offered his obeisances to all, including Sugriva and the Wind-God, he surveyed all directions, his gaze fixed upon the Ashoka grove.
'61': Proceeding with resolve, his mind recalled the erstwhile auspicious Ashoka grove, and the wind-born vanara then contemplated the northern direction.
'62': Surely, there will be a multitude of protectors in the forest—an abundant throng of vanaras—and the venerable Ashoka grove, sanctified by all refined practices, is renowned.
'63': Moreover, those appointed as guardians here indeed protect the foliage, and even the Supreme, the Universal Soul, permits no disorder to arise.
'64': Condensed in purpose, I, with my very self, am engaged in the cause of Rama and in opposition to Ravana; may all the gods and the celestial hosts grant me success here.
'65': May Brahma, the self-born, the Lord, the deities, and the revered ascetics—as well as Siddhi-Agni, Vayu, and Puruhuta, the bearer of thunderbolts—attend to my cause.
'66': Likewise, may Varuna with his noose, along with Soma, Aditya, the twin Ashvins, the noble ones, and Marut all lend their benediction.
'67': He who is the Lord of all beings and who endows success upon every creature shall also render service to me—even those unseen along the path shall offer their obeisance.
'68': I shall behold that lofty figure with pearly, unblemished teeth and eyes like the petals of the lotus; whose radiant countenance, comparable to the blissful lord of delight, shall ever be manifest before me.
'69': How is it possible that the feeble, downtrodden image—adorned in terrifying raiment and seemingly weak despite the semblance of might—should not appear upon my vision this day?
'-1': Thus concludes the thirteenth sarga, named ‘Hanuman Nirveda’, in the Sundara Kanda of the revered Valmiki Ramayana, the ancient epic.
