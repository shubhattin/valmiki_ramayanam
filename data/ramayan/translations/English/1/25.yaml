'0': And now, the 25th chapter in the Childhood Section of Valmiki Ramayanam, named 'Tataka's Tale'.
'1': 'Hearing the excellent words of that incomprehensible sage, the tiger among men (Rama) replied in auspicious words:'
'2': '"O eminent sage, it is heard that the Yakshini is weak in strength. How, then, does this weak one bear the strength of a thousand elephants?"'
'3': 'Hearing the words of the immensely powerful Raghava, Vishwamitra, delighting both Rama and Lakshmana with his gentle words, spoke:'
'4': '"Listen, O hero, to how she possesses such immense strength. It is due to a boon granted to her that this weak one has the power.'
'5': '"Long ago, there was a great Yaksha named Suketu, who was valorous and virtuous. He had no children and performed great penance.'
'6': '"Pleased with his penance, Brahma, the great progenitor, granted him a daughter, O Rama, who was named Tataka.'
'7': '"Brahma also gave her the strength of a thousand elephants, but he did not grant a son to the great Yaksha.'
'8': '"When she grew up, radiant with beauty and youth, her illustrious father gave her in marriage to Sunda, the son of Jambha.'
'9': '"After some time, the Yakshini gave birth to a son named Maricha, who became invincible and, due to a curse, was turned into a Rakshasa.'
'10': '"When Sunda was killed, O Rama, the great sage Agastya became the target of Tataka''s desire for vengeance, along with her son.'
'11': '"Enraged, she came roaring towards him with the intent of devouring him. Seeing her approaching, the divine sage Agastya'
'12': '"uttered a curse in his great anger: ''Become a Rakshasa!'' and thus transformed Maricha. He also cursed Tataka,'
'13': '"saying, ''You, great Yakshini, with a misshapen face, abandon this form at once and assume a dreadful appearance.'''
'14': '"Since then, driven by the fury brought upon by the curse, Tataka, filled with rage, has been ravaging this once sacred region sanctified by Agastya.'
'15': '"O Raghava, kill this wicked and extremely dreadful Yakshini for the protection of cows and Brahmanas, and put an end to her wicked deeds.'
'16': '"No one in the three worlds, except you, O delight of the Raghus, is capable of killing her, as she is afflicted by a curse.'
'17': '"Do not feel any pity for killing a woman, O best among men. For the welfare of the four social orders, it is a duty for the son of a king.'
'18': '"Whether it appears cruel or not, whether it is sinful or faulty, a king must always protect his people by any means necessary.'
'19': '"This is the eternal duty of those appointed to govern a kingdom. Slay this unrighteous one, O Kakutstha, for there is no righteousness in her.'
'20': '"It is said that in ancient times, Indra killed Manthara, the daughter of Virochana, who intended to destroy the earth.'
'21': '"In earlier times, too, Vishnu killed Kavyamata, the chaste wife of Bhrigu, when she desired a world without Indra.'
'22': '"Many such women, involved in unrighteousness, have been slain by noble princes and great men. Therefore, O king, abandon pity and slay her at my command."'
'-1': Thus, is the 25th chapter in the Childhood Section of Valmiki Ramayanam, named 'Tataka's Tale'.
