'0': And now, the 18th chapter in the Childhood Section of Valmiki Ramayanam, named 'Incarnation of Shri Rama'.
'1': When the great Ashvamedha sacrifice of the noble King Dasharatha was completed, the gods, having received their shares, returned to their respective abodes.
'2': Having completed his vows and rituals, the king, accompanied by his queens, entered his city with his attendants, army, and vehicles.
'3': The kings of the earth, honored appropriately by the king, departed joyfully to their respective lands after saluting the foremost of sages.
'4': As the illustrious kings departed for their homes, the white and splendid armies of the kings shone brightly with joy.
'5': After the kings had left, the glorious King Dasharatha, placing the best of the Brahmins in front, re-entered his city.
'6': The highly respected Rishyasringa, who had been greatly honored, departed with his wife, escorted by the intelligent king and his retinue.
'7': Thus, having respectfully sent everyone off, the king, with a heart full of contentment, stayed in happiness, thinking about the birth of sons.
'8': When the sacrifice was completed, six seasons passed, and then in the twelfth month, on the ninth day of the month of Chaitra,
'9': With the moon in conjunction with Jupiter in the constellation of Cancer, and the asterism of Punarvasu presided over by Aditi, Rama, the lord of the world and revered by all, was born.
'10': At the auspicious hour, Kausalya gave birth to Rama, adorned with divine characteristics, the protector of the world and revered by all.
'11': He was the embodiment of half of Vishnu, and he shone with immense glory. He was the joy of the Ikshvaku dynasty, with red eyes, long arms, and a voice like a drum.
'12': Kausalya glowed with the brilliance of her son, as Aditi, the mother of the gods, was illumined by Indra, the wielder of the thunderbolt.
'13': Kaikeyi gave birth to Bharata, a prince of true valor, who was a direct portion of Vishnu, and who possessed all noble qualities.
'14': Sumitra gave birth to two sons, the valiant Lakshmana and Shatrughna, both highly skilled in weaponry, and each possessing half of Vishnu’s might.
'15': Bharata was born under the Pushya constellation with a calm mind, and the two sons of Sumitra, Lakshmana and Shatrughna, were born under the Ashlesha constellation.
'16': Thus, four noble sons, each born with great virtues, were born to the righteous King Dasharatha, resembling the four auspicious stars in the sky.
'17': Gandharvas sang melodious songs, Apsaras danced, and the celestial drums resounded as flowers rained down from the heavens.
'18': A great celebration filled the city of Ayodhya, thronged with people. The streets were crowded with joyful men, dancers, and performers.
'19': The city shone with grand processions, accompanied by musicians and singers, and was filled with all kinds of jewels and treasures.
'20': The king gave away gifts to bards, heralds, and singers. He gave wealth to the Brahmins and distributed thousands of cows.
'21': On the eleventh day, after the birth ceremonies were completed, the king joyfully performed the naming ceremony for his sons.
'22': The sage Vasishta, filled with great joy, named the eldest son Rama, Kaikeyi's son Bharata, and the others Lakshmana and Shatrughna.
'23': The king joyfully fed Brahmins and the citizens, offering a great abundance of jewels to the Brahmins.
'24': The king performed all the rituals for his sons’ births, and Rama, the eldest and dearest to his father, stood as the banner of the Ikshvaku dynasty.
'25': All four sons were learned in the Vedas, valiant, and committed to the welfare of all beings, with their virtues shining brightly.
'26': Of all the brothers, Rama, endowed with great brilliance, was the most virtuous and possessed true valor.
'27': Beloved by all the people, Rama, pure like the moon, was highly esteemed in riding elephants, horses, and chariots.
'28': He was dedicated to the study of archery and was always devoted to serving his father. Lakshmana, ever affectionate from childhood, grew in prosperity.
'29': Lakshmana was always devoted to his elder brother Rama, who was the joy of the world. He did everything to please him and loved him dearly.
'30': Lakshmana, rich in fortune, was like another external life-force for Rama. Without Lakshmana, Rama could not sleep.
'31': When delicious food was brought, Rama would not eat without Lakshmana. Whenever Rama mounted a horse and went hunting, Lakshmana followed him, bow in hand.
'32': Similarly, Shatrughna, the younger brother of Bharata, was always devoted to Bharata and followed him as Lakshmana did with Rama.
'33': Thus, King Dasharatha was exceedingly delighted, having these four glorious and beloved sons, just as Brahma rejoices with the gods.
'34': These sons, endowed with knowledge, virtue, and modesty, became a source of great joy for their father, like Brahma to the lords of the worlds.
'35': Possessing great intellect and renown, full of knowledge, and long-sighted in wisdom, these radiant sons brought great delight to Dasharatha.
'36': The tiger-like sons of King Dasharatha were engaged in the study of the Vedas, devoted to the service of their father, and firmly established in the science of weaponry.
'37': The virtuous King Dasharatha, with the counsel of his priests and relatives, began to contemplate the marriages of his sons.
'38': While the king, with great wisdom, was pondering over this matter among his ministers, the mighty sage Vishwamitra arrived.
'39': Desiring an audience with the king, the radiant sage Vishwamitra, the son of Gadhi, spoke to the gatekeepers.
'40': “Hurry, inform the king that Vishwamitra, the son of Gadhi, has arrived.” Hearing these words, they rushed to the palace.
'41': All were startled and excited by these words. They quickly entered the royal palace and announced the arrival of the great sage Vishwamitra to the king.
'42': Hearing this, the king, with his priests and ministers, was filled with great joy and came out to meet the sage, just as Indra welcomes Brahma.
'43': Upon seeing the radiant, ascetic sage, firm in his vows, the king, with a delighted heart, offered him a ceremonial welcome.
'44': Receiving the ritual offerings from the king, Vishwamitra, following the prescribed rites, inquired about the king’s welfare and well-being.
'45': The righteous sage inquired about the prosperity of the kingdom, the treasury, the people, and the king’s friends and relatives.
'46': Vishwamitra then asked about the king's victories over his enemies and whether divine and human tasks had been well-executed.
'47': After meeting Vasishta and the other sages, Vishwamitra, filled with joy, greeted them appropriately.
'48': All the sages, filled with delight, entered the king’s palace, where they were welcomed with honor and seated respectfully.
'49': The king, extremely delighted, warmly welcomed the great sage Vishwamitra with great joy and reverence.
'50': “O revered sage, your arrival is as auspicious as the arrival of nectar or as rain after a long drought.”
'51': “It is as joyous as the birth of a son to a childless man, as the recovery of a lost treasure, or the return of great fortune.”
'52': “Your arrival is equally as welcome. O great sage, what is your desire? What can I do for you, as I am filled with joy?”
'54': '"Since I have had the opportunity to see you, the greatest of Brahmins, this night has brought auspiciousness to me. Formerly, you illuminated the world with your penance under the name of ''Rajrishi,'' and now you have attained the status of a ''Brahmarishi.''"'
'55': '"You have earned the highest respect in various ways, and your presence is a great wonder for me. Indeed, it is the most sacred and auspicious event for me."'
'56': '"Having come to this holy place, and through your blessed sight, O lord, tell me the purpose of your visit and what I can do for you."'
'57': '"I desire to be blessed by fulfilling your purpose and hope you will not hesitate to ask. Consider your task done without delay, O virtuous one."'
'58': '"To me, you are like a deity. Your arrival has brought me great fortune, and your very presence has established supreme righteousness."'
'59': '"Upon hearing these heartfelt, humble, and pleasant words, which were not only soothing to the ears but also uttered by a wise and virtuous person, the great sage (Rishyashringa), who was well-known for his virtues, experienced supreme joy."'
'-1': Thus, is the 18th chapter in the Childhood Section of Valmiki Ramayanam, named 'Incarnation of Shri Rama'.
