'0': And now, the 9th chapter in the Childhood Section of Valmiki Ramayanam, named 'Rshyashringa's Tale'.
'1': Upon hearing this, the charioteer confidentially said to the king, "Listen to this ancient tale, which I heard from the Purana."
'2': '"This ancient story was recounted to me by the revered sage Sanatkumara in the presence of other sages, regarding the birth of your sons."'
'3': There is a renowned sage named Kashyapa, and it is said that he has a son named Vibhandaka.
'4': Vibhandaka would then beget a son known as Rishyashringa. He grows up in the wilderness and becomes an ascetic, always wandering in the forest.
'5': He knows no one but his father, and this great soul would follow two forms of celibacy (Brahmacharya) and live a life of virtue."
'6': O king, this is known to the sages and is well-established in the world. As time passes, his destiny would unfold.
'7': While the illustrious sage was attending to the fire and his father, at that same time, there was a powerful king named Romapada, renowned in the region of Anga.
'8': Due to an error committed by this king, a terrible calamity befell his kingdom. It was a dreadful drought that filled the world with fear.
'9': '"As the drought continued, the king, overwhelmed by sorrow, gathered learnt and experienced Brahmins to seek a solution."'
'10': The king addressed the Brahmins, saying, "O learnt ones, who are well-versed in sacred rituals and the moral conduct of the world, please prescribe a course of action, including penance, to atone for this."
'11': Thus, urged by the king, all the foremost Brahmins convened and prepared to offer their wise counsel on how the king could rectify the situation.
'12': Having been addressed by the king, the Brahmins, who are masters of the Vedas, responded, saying, 'O king, summon the son of Vibhandaka here by any means.'"
'13': '"Bring Rishyashringa, the learnt Brahmin and the son of Vibhandaka, with great respect, and offer him your daughter Shanta in marriage according to the prescribed rituals."'
'14': '"After hearing their words, the king pondered, ''By what means can this mighty sage be brought here?''"'
'15': '"After careful consideration with his ministers, the wise king will send his priests and ministers, treating them with great respect."'
'16': '"However, upon hearing the king''s command, they will be filled with fear, reluctant to approach the sage, and will try to persuade the king not to send them."'
'17': '"After thoughtful deliberation, they will inform the king that they will find a way to bring the sage without causing any harm."'
'18': '"Then, with the help of experienced courtesans, the king of Anga will invite Rishyashringa to the realm, causing rains to fall, and marrying his daughter Shanta to the sage."'
'19': '"Rishyashringa, as your son-in-law, will ensure the birth of your sons. This is the story I heard from Sanatkumara."'
'20': Upon hearing this, King Dasharatha was overjoyed and said to Sumanta, "Find a way to bring Rishyashringa here by whatever means necessary."
