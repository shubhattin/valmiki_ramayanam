'1': Upon hearing this, the charioteer confidentially said to the king, "Listen to this ancient tale, which I heard from the Purana."
'2': '"This ancient story was recounted to me by the revered sage Sanatkumara in the presence of other sages, regarding the birth of your sons."'
'3': '"There is a renowned sage named Kashyapa, and it is said that he has a son named Vibhandaka."'
'4': '"Vibhandakaâ€™s son will be known as Rishyashringa, who will grow up in the forest, always living as a sage."'
'5': '"He will know no one but his father, and this great soul will follow two forms of celibacy (Brahmacharya) and live a life of virtue."'
'6': '"O king, this is known to the sages and is well-established in the world. As time passes, his destiny will unfold."'
'7': '"While the illustrious sage was attending to the fire and his father, at that same time, there was a powerful king named Romapada, renowned in the region of Anga."'
'8': '"Due to an error committed by this king, a terrible calamity befell his kingdom. It was a dreadful drought that filled the world with fear."'
'9': '"As the drought continued, the king, overwhelmed by sorrow, gathered learned and experienced Brahmins to seek a solution."'
'10': The king addressed the Brahmins, saying, "O learned ones, who are well-versed in sacred rituals and the moral conduct of the world, please prescribe a course of action, including penance, to atone for this."
'11': Thus, urged by the king, all the foremost Brahmins convened and prepared to offer their wise counsel on how the king could rectify the situation.
'12': Having been addressed by the king, the Brahmins, who are masters of the Vedas, will respond, saying, 'O king, summon the son of Vibhandaka here by any means.'"
'13': '"Bring Rishyashringa, the learned Brahmin and the son of Vibhandaka, with great respect, and offer him your daughter Shanta in marriage according to the prescribed rituals."'
'14': '"After hearing their words, the king will ponder, ''By what means can this mighty sage be brought here?''"'
'15': '"After careful consideration with his ministers, the wise king will send his priests and ministers, treating them with great respect."'
'16': '"However, upon hearing the king''s command, they will be filled with fear, reluctant to approach the sage, and will try to persuade the king not to send them."'
'17': '"After thoughtful deliberation, they will inform the king that they will find a way to bring the sage without causing any harm."'
'18': '"Then, with the help of skilled courtesans, the king of Anga will bring Rishyashringa to the kingdom, causing the rains to fall, and he will give his daughter Shanta to the sage in marriage."'
'19': '"Rishyashringa, as your son-in-law, will ensure the birth of your sons. This is the story I heard from Sanatkumara."'
'20': Upon hearing this, King Dasharatha was overjoyed and said to Sumanta, "Find a way to bring Rishyashringa here by whatever means necessary."
'-1': Thus, is the 9th chapter in the Childhood Section of Valmiki Ramayanam, named 'Rshyashringa's Tale'.
