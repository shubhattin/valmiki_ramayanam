'0': And now, the 20th chapter in the Childhood Section of Valmiki Ramayanam, named 'Dasharatha's Response'.
'1': Hearing the words of Vishwamitra, the tiger among kings, Dasharatha, became unconscious for a moment and, regaining his senses, spoke...
'2': “My son, Rama, who has eyes like a lotus, is not yet sixteen years old. I do not see him as fit to fight against the Rakshasas in battle.”
'3': “I have a powerful army, an Akshauhini, which I command as its leader. Accompanied by this army, I shall go and fight against those night-dwelling Rakshasas.”
'4': “These valiant and courageous servants of mine, skilled in the use of weapons, are capable of fighting against the Rakshasas. You must not take Rama with you.”
'5': “I, armed with a bow, will protect you in the midst of battle. As long as I live, I shall fight against the night-dwelling Rakshasas.”
'6': “Your vow will be completed without hindrance and will be well-protected. I shall come there myself, but you must not take Rama.”
'7': “He is young and has not yet acquired full knowledge. He does not know the strength of the enemy or his own. He has not mastered the use of weapons, nor is he experienced in warfare.”
'8': “Rama is not suitable for fighting against Rakshasas, who are skilled in deceitful warfare. O best of sages, I cannot live for even a moment without Rama by my side.”
'9': “O Brahmin, if you wish to take Raghava, take him along with me and my fourfold army, O Kausika.”
'10': “I am now sixty thousand years old, and it was with great difficulty that I begot this son. You must not take Rama away.”
'11': “My love for my four sons is profound, especially for my eldest, who is devoted to righteousness. You must not take Rama.”
'12': “Who are these Rakshasas, and what is their strength? Who are their parents, and what are their origins, O foremost of sages?”
'13': “What is their form, and who protects them, O great sage? How can Rama confront these Rakshasas?”
'14': “Or should I confront them with my army, or should I go myself? Tell me everything, O revered one, about how I should face these deceitful Rakshasas in battle.”
'15': “The Rakshasas are filled with malice and arrogance. Upon hearing these words, Vishwamitra replied to the king.”
'16': “There is a Rakshasa named Ravana, born in the lineage of Pulastya, who was granted a boon by Brahma and greatly harasses the three worlds.”
'17': “He is extremely powerful and immensely courageous, surrounded by many Rakshasas. You must have heard of Ravana, the lord of the Rakshasas.”
'18': “He is the brother of Kubera, the son of the sage Vishrava. However, it is not Ravana who directly causes the hindrance to the sacrifice.”
'19': “Two other Rakshasas, Maricha and Subahu, who are extremely powerful, are incited by Ravana to obstruct the sacrifice.”
'20': Hearing this from the sage, the king then said, “I am not capable of standing against that wicked one in battle.”
'21': “O knower of righteousness, please show favor to my son. You are like a deity to me, O revered one, and I am unfortunate.”
'22': “Even the gods, Danavas, Gandharvas, Yakshas, birds, and serpents cannot withstand Ravana, so how can humans defeat him in battle?”
'23': “Ravana takes away the strength of the valiant in battle. Therefore, I am not capable of fighting against him or his forces.”
'24': “Even with my army, or along with my sons, how can I fight against one who is like an immortal, when my sons are inexperienced in war?”
'25': “I will not give my young son, O Brahmin, nor can I give him up to face these two Rakshasas, who are like Sunda and Upasunda in battle.”
'26': “Maricha and Subahu are powerful and well-trained. They are capable of causing great harm to the sacrifice. I shall not give me dear son for their cause.”
'27': With my entire army, I will go and fight either one of them. Otherwise, I will forcefully take you, along with your relatives, if you refuse.
'28': Listening to these hesitant words spoken by the king, immense anger surged within the great sage Vishwamitra, as if a well-kindled sacrificial fire, fueled with clarified butter, were to blaze up with intensity.
'-1': Thus, is the 20th chapter in the Childhood Section of Valmiki Ramayanam, named 'Dasharatha's Response'.
