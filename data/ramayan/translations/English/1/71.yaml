'0': Thus addressed, King Janaka, with folded hands, replied, "May you be blessed! You deserve to hear about our lineage in detail.
'1': O best of sages, it is indeed necessary to speak of one's lineage completely when giving a daughter in marriage. Therefore, O great-minded one, listen to our lineage.
'2': In the three worlds, there was a king named Nimi, renowned for his deeds, who was the supreme righteous soul and the best among all beings.
'3': His son was named Mithi, and Janaka was the son of Mithi. The first king Janaka was followed by Udavasu.
'4': From Udavasu was born the righteous Nandivardhana, and Nandivardhana's son was the valiant Suketu.
'5': From Suketu was born the righteous and mighty Devarata, and from the royal sage Devarata was born Brihadratha.
'6': Brihadratha's son was the heroic and mighty Mahavira, and Mahavira's son was the steadfast and truthful Sudhriti.
'7': From Sudhriti was born the righteous and virtuous Dhrishtaketu, and from the royal sage Dhrishtaketu was born the renowned Haryashva.
'8': Haryashva's son was Maru, and Maru's son was Pratindhaka. Pratindhaka's son was the righteous King Kirtiratha.
'9': Kirtiratha's son was known as Devamidha, and Devamidha's son was Vibudha, and Vibudha's son was Mahidhaka.
'10': Mahidhaka's son was the mighty King Kirtirata, and from the royal sage Kirtirata was born Maharoma.
'11': From Maharoma was born the righteous Swarnaroma, and from the royal sage Swarnaroma was born Hrasvaroma.
'12': This righteous king, my father, had two sons. I am the elder, and my younger brother is the valiant Kushadhvaja.
'13': My father, having anointed me as the king, entrusted the responsibility to me and went to the forest, placing Kushadhvaja under my care.
'14': When my aged father ascended to heaven, I took on the burden of the kingdom with righteousness, always looking upon my brother Kushadhvaja with affection.
'15': After some time, a valorous king named Sudhanva came from the city of Sankasya and besieged Mithila.
'16': He sent me an invincible bow of Shiva and demanded that the lotus-eyed maiden Sita be given to him.
'17': O great sage, as I did not give her, a battle ensued between us, and in that battle, I killed King Sudhanva, who faced me.
'18': Having slain the king Sudhanva, the best of sages, I anointed my valiant brother Kushadhvaja as the king of Sankasya.
'19': This younger brother of mine, O great sage, I am the elder. I am exceedingly pleased to give you the brides.
'20': May Sita be given to Rama, and Urmila to Lakshmana. My daughter Sita, who is like a celestial maiden, is given as a reward for valor.
'21': I say thrice, without a doubt, that I am exceedingly pleased to give you the brides, O best of sages.
'22': O king, arrange for the gifting of cows for Rama and Lakshmana, and perform the rites for the ancestors. Then conduct the marriage ceremony.
'23': Today is the third day of the Magha month, O mighty-armed one. On the auspicious day of Uttara Phalguni, conduct the marriage ceremony for Rama and Lakshmana, which will bring about happiness.
'-1': Thus ends the seventy-first sarga named 'The Promise of Giving Daughters in Marriage' in the Balakanda of the holy Ramayana composed by sage Valmiki.
