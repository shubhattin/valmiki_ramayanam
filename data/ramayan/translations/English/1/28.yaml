'0': And now, the 28th chapter in the Childhood Section of Valmiki Ramayanam, named 'Receiving Counter-Astras'.
'1': 'Receiving the divine weapons, pure and with a joyful face, Rama then spoke to Vishwamitra as they continued their journey:'
'2': '"I have received the weapons, O revered one, and have become invincible, even to the gods. O eminent sage, I also wish to learn how to retract these weapons."'
'3': Hearing Kakutstha's words, the great ascetic Vishwamitra, full of resolve and purity, began to teach him the methods of retraction.
'4': '"I grant you the power of retraction for the weapons known as Satyavanta, Satyakirti, Dhrita, and Rabhasa."'
'5': '"And for the weapons named Pratiharatara, Parangmukha, and Avangmukha, as well as Lakshya and Alakshya, along with Dridhanabha and Sunabha."'
'6': '"The divine weapons are Dashaksha, Shatavaktra, Dashashirsha, Shatodara, Padmanabha, Mahanabha, Dundunabha, and Svanabha."'
'7': '"Jyotisha, Shakuna, Nairashya, Vimalau, Yougandhara, Vinidra, Daityapramathana, Shuchibahu, Mahabahu, Nishkali, Viruchas."'
'8': '"Sarchi, Dhritimali, Vrttiman, Ruchi, Pitrya, Soumanasa, Vidhuutamakara, Paravira, Rati, Dhanadhanya."'
'9': '"Kamarupa, Kamaruchi, Moha, Avarana, Jrimbhaka, Sarpanabha, and Panthanavarana."'
'10': '"O Rama, receive these luminous, powerful sons of Krishashva, capable of assuming various forms, for you are deserving, O Raghava."'
'11': '"Thus addressed, Kakutstha gladly accepted, and in radiant, divine forms, the retracted weapons appeared, comforting and pleasing."'
'12': '"Some of them looked like burning embers; some resembled smoke, while others were as bright as the sun and the moon, standing with folded hands."'
'13': '"With joined palms, they spoke sweetly to Rama, ''O tiger among men, command usâ€”what should we do for you?"'
'14': '"Raghunandana replied, ''Depart as you wish, but assist me mentally whenever the need arises."'
'15': '"Then, bidding Rama farewell, they circumambulated him and said, ''So be it, O Kakutstha,'' before leaving as they had come."'
'16': '"Recognising their departure, Rama then addressed the great sage Vishwamitra with a gentle and sweet voice as they continued walking:'
'17': '"What is that grove resembling a cloud that appears not far from the mountain? My curiosity is piqued."'
'18': '"It looks beautiful, filled with deer, and is adorned with various delightful birds, making charming sounds."'
'19': '"We seem to have emerged from the terrifying forest, O foremost of sages, and by the pleasantness of this region, I sense comfort and peace here."'
'20': '"Please tell me everything, O revered one. Whose hermitage is this, into which those sinful demons, murderers of Brahmanas, have come?"'
'21': '"For the purpose of obstructing your sacrifice, those wicked ones were here. O great Sage, what is this place? Where is the site of your sacrifice?"'
'22': '"I wish to know everything, O best of sages. I will protect your sacrificial rites and slay the Rakshasas. I wish to hear all of this from you, O lord."'
'-1': Thus is the 28th chapter in the Childhood Section of the Valmiki Ramayanam, named 'Receiving Counter-Astras'.
