'0': And now, the 5th chapter in the Childhood Section of Valmiki Ramayanam, named 'Ayodhya's Beauty'.
'1': In ancient times, the entire earth belonged to victorious kings, starting with Prajapati (the lord of all creatures).
'2': Among them was King Sagara, after whom the ocean was named. His sixty thousand sons surrounded him as he moved forward.
'3': In the dynasty of these great kings of the Ikshvaku lineage, the great story of Ramayana was born and is famously known.
'4': We shall now narrate this complete story from the beginning, which is filled with the principles of dharma, kama (desires), and artha (wealth). Listen to it without any ill will.
'5': There was a great, prosperous kingdom called Kosala, filled with wealth and grains, situated on the banks of the Sarayu River.
'6': In that kingdom was a city named Ayodhya, which was renowned throughout the world. It was built by Manu, the foremost among humans, himself.
'7': The great city extended twelve yojanas (around 144 km) in length and three yojanas (around 36 km) in breadth. It was beautifully laid out with broad and well-divided roads.
'8': The city was adorned with large, well-organised streets and royal highways, always sprinkled with water and covered with flowers.
'9': King Dasharatha, who expanded his kingdom and was a great monarch, lived in this city, as the king of gods, Indra, resided in heaven.
'10': The city had grand gates and archways, well-arranged marketplaces, and was equipped with all types of weapons and machines. It was filled with skilled artisans.
'11': It was crowded with charioteers and bards, and its glory was unmatched. The city had tall buildings with flags and was filled with hundreds of deadly weapons.
'12': It was adorned with troupes of dancers and actors, surrounded by beautiful gardens and groves of mango trees, and girded with massive walls of Sala trees.
'13': The city had deep, impregnable moats and was difficult for enemies to approach. It was full of horses, elephants, cattle, camels, and donkeys.
'14': It was surrounded by tributary kings who paid homage and was adorned with merchants from various regions who added to its beauty.
'15': The city was embellished with palaces made of jewels, resembling mountains, and was filled with multi-story mansions, much like the city of Indra, Amaravati.
'16': It was intricately designed in the shape of an eight-petalled lotus and filled with beautiful women. It was adorned with all types of gems and shining with splendid homes and palaces.
'17': The city was tightly packed with well-arranged houses and perfectly laid out on flat land. It was full of grains of rice and filled with sugarcane juice and water.
'18': The city resounded with the sounds of drums, mridangas, veenas, and panavas (a type of drum), creating a delightful and intense melody, making it unparalleled on earth.
'19': It was like a celestial city attained by the Siddhas through austerities in heaven, with well-arranged homes and populated by the best of men.
'20': There were warriors who could hit invisible targets with their arrows and skilled archers who could strike based on sound alone. They were quick-handed and highly proficient.
'21': The forests resounded with the roars of lions, tigers, and boars. These mighty warriors, with sharp weapons and powerful arms, hunted them.
'22': King Dasharatha filled this city with thousands of such great warriors and charioteers, making it truly a magnificent city.
'23': The city was filled with learnt brahmins who were skilled in the six branches of Vedic knowledge. They were generous, truthful, and as great as sages, performing rituals with excellence.
'-1': Thus is the 5th chapter in the Childhood Section of Valmiki Ramayanam, named 'Ayodhya's Beauty'.
