'0': And now, the 24th chapter in the Childhood Section of Valmiki Ramayanam, named 'Entering Tataka Grove'.
'1': At dawn, the clear morning arrived, and the subduers of enemies, Rama and Lakshmana, completed their morning rituals and, led by Vishwamitra, approached the riverbank.
'2': 'There, the great sages of stringent vows pulled out a lovely boat and spoke to Vishwamitra:'
'3': '"Let Your Honour board the boat, with the princes leading. May you have a safe journey without any delay."'
'4': Vishwamitra agreed, honoured those sages, and, accompanied by the two brothers, crossed the river that flows into the ocean.
'5': While in the middle of the river, they heard a loud sound, amplified by the water’s turbulence.
'6': 'Desiring to know the cause of that sound, the radiant Rama, with his younger brother, asked the eminent sage:'
'7': '"What is this tumultuous sound coming from the breaking waters?" Hearing Raghava''s words, filled with curiosity,'
'8': 'The virtuous sage began to explain the origin of that sound: "O Rama, on Mount Kailasa, there was once a great lake, created by Brahma''s mind.'
'9': '"From that lake, called Maanasa, the sacred Sarayu river emerged and then flowed towards Ayodhya."'
'10': '"This Sarayu, sacred and originating from Brahma''s lake, joins with the Jahnavi (Ganga). This unmatchable sound comes from that confluence."'
'11': '"This sound, caused by the water''s agitation, should be saluted." Upon this instruction, the two virtuous brothers bow down in reverence.'
'12': '"Reaching the southern bank, the two, light-footed, continued their journey. Seeing a dense and fearful forest, the prince of the Ikshvakus asked the eminent sage:'
'13': '"This forest is difficult to traverse, filled with hordes of crickets, terrifying beasts, and birds making dreadful cries."'
'14': '"It is filled with various kinds of birds, their calls echoing, and is inhabited by lions, tigers, boars, and elephants."'
'15': '"With clusters of Dhava, Ashvakarna, Kakubha, Bilva, Tinduka, and Patala trees, and mingled with Badari shrubs, what is this dreadful forest?"'
'16': The highly radiant Vishwamitra, the great sage, replied, "Listen, O dear Kakutstha, about whom this dreadful forest belongs."
'17': '"There were once two prosperous regions here, O foremost of men—Malada and Karusha, created by divine intent."'
'18': '"After Vritra''s destruction, this region was polluted by the residue of Indra''s sin of slaying a Brahmana."'
'19': '"Due to his action, the thousand-eyed Indra was afflicted by hunger and by the sin of Brahma-hatya. Seeing Indra tainted, the gods and the ascetics, filled with penance,'
'20': '"bathed him with water, purifying him from the sin. Here on this land, they deposited his impurities—both Malada and Karusha."'
'21': '"When the bodily impurity of Mahendra (Indra) was given to the earth, he became pure and free from blemish."'
'22': '"Pleased, he granted a great boon to the region: ‘These two regions, Malada and Karusha, will become renowned in the world."'
'23': '"The gods then praised Indra, who was pleased, saying, ‘Well done, well done!’ The land, honoured by Indra, flourished with prosperity."'
'24': '"The regions of Malada and Karusha, filled with wealth and grain, remained happy for a long time."'
'25': '"After some time, a Yakshini of immense power, capable of bearing the strength of a thousand elephants, appeared."'
'26': '"She was named Tataka, blessed one, and was the wife of the wise Sunda. Their son was Maricha, the Rakshasa, with the prowess of Indra."'
'27': '"With mighty arms, a massive head, a large mouth, and a gigantic body, this Rakshasa with a terrifying appearance constantly terrorises the people."'
'28': '"He continuously devastates these two regions, Malada and Karusha, O Raghava."'
'29': '"This wicked Tataka, assuming various forms, resides half a Yojana away, obstructing the path."'
'30': '"Therefore, it is necessary to go to her forest. With the strength of your arms, you must slay this wicked one."'
'31': '"At my command, make this land free from thorns again. No one else is able to travel through this area."'
'32': '"The terrible Yakshini has devastated this place, making it impassable, O Rama. I have told you everything about why this forest is dreadful. The Yakshini’s devastation has not yet ended."'
'-1': Thus is the 24th chapter in the Childhood Section of the Valmiki Ramayanam, named 'Entering Tataka Grove'.
