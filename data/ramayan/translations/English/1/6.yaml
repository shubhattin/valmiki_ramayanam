'0': And now, the 6th chapter in the Childhood Section of Valmiki Ramayanam, named 'Majesty of the King'.
'1': In that city of Ayodhya lived a wise king, learned in the Vedas, who had a comprehensive understanding of all matters, far-sighted, immensely powerful, and beloved by the citizens and those from the countryside.
'2': He was an extraordinary charioteer among the Ikshvaku kings, a devout performer of sacrifices, steadfast in righteousness, self-controlled, and a king-sage who was as renowned in the three worlds as a great rishi.
'3': King Dasharatha, who was immensely powerful, had defeated his enemies, had many friends, and was victorious over his senses. In wealth and prosperity, he was comparable to Indra and Kubera.
'4': Just as the great Manu, the protector of all beings, had once guarded the world, so did King Dasharatha protect the people.
'5': With his commitment to truth and righteousness, the great king maintained the three goals of life—dharma (righteousness), artha (wealth), and kama (desires)—and protected the great city as Indra protected Amaravati.
'6': In that splendid city, righteous men who were well-versed in scriptures, content, and free from greed, lived happily, speaking only the truth.
'7': No householder in that great city of Ayodhya was poor, devoid of wealth, cattle, horses, or grains. Every household had an abundance of resources.
'8': In Ayodhya, there was not a single person who was lustful, miserly, cruel, or lacking in knowledge. There was no one who was unwise or unfaithful.
'9': All the men and women of the city were virtuous and well-disciplined. They were joyful in their good conduct and virtues, resembling great sages in purity.
'10': There was no one in the city who did not wear earrings, crowns, or garlands, nor was there anyone who lacked fine attire, sweet fragrances, or proper grooming.
'11': No one in the city was seen who did not enjoy good food, who did not give in charity, or who did not wear armlets or necklaces. No one was seen who lacked self-control.
'12': There was no one in Ayodhya who did not maintain the sacred fire, who did not perform sacrifices, who was not charitable, or who was a thief or sinner. The city was free of those who engaged in immoral behavior or illicit relationships.
'13': The Brahmins in the city were constantly engaged in their duties, mastering their senses, practicing charity and study, and were well-controlled in receiving gifts.
'14': There was no one who was an atheist or a liar, nor was there anyone who was poorly learned. No one was jealous, weak, or ignorant.
'15': There was no one who did not know the six branches of Vedic knowledge, who did not observe vows, or who was incapable of giving charity. No one in the city was destitute or mentally disturbed.
'16': There was no one in Ayodhya, whether man or woman, who lacked wealth or beauty. Nor was there anyone who did not possess devotion to the king.
'17': In all four varnas (social classes), people worshipped gods and guests, were grateful, generous, brave, and endowed with valor.
'18': The men of Ayodhya lived long lives, adhered to dharma and truth, and were always surrounded by their wives, sons, and grandsons in happiness.
'19': The Kshatriyas (warrior class) ruled under the guidance of the Brahmins, while the Vaishyas (merchant class) followed the lead of the Kshatriyas. The Shudras (laborer class) were devoted to serving the other three varnas.
'20': The city of Ayodhya was excellently protected by the Ikshvaku king, just as it had been earlier by the wise King Manu, the foremost of men.
'21': It was filled with well-trained warriors, as fierce as fire, who were skilled and unyielding, much like lions in their lairs.
'22': The city was filled with the best horses from the Kamboja and Bahlika regions, as well as from the forests and rivers, with excellent horses and chariots.
'23': It was also filled with mighty elephants born in the Vindhya and Himalayan regions, strong, intoxicated, and resembling mountains in their strength.
'24': There were elephants of the Airavata and Mahapadma species, along with others from Anjana and Vamana, all highly trained and powerful.
'25': The city was always filled with elephants that resembled mountains and were always intoxicated. It also had a large number of auspicious horses and elephants.
'26': This city, which stretched for two yojanas (approximately 24 km), was called the city of truth, and King Dasharatha ruled the world while living in this splendid city.
'27': The great and powerful King Dasharatha, who had subdued his enemies, ruled over Ayodhya, much like the moon shines over the stars.
'28': The great city of Ayodhya, known for its strong gates and diverse, beautiful houses, filled with thousands of citizens, was ruled by the great King Dasharatha, who was equal to Indra in might.
'-1': Thus, is the 6th chapter in the Childhood Section of Valmiki Ramayanam, named 'Majesty of the King'.
