'0': And now, the 26th chapter in the Childhood Section of Valmiki Ramayanam, named 'Slaying Tataka'.
'1': Hearing the resolute words of the sage, the tiger among men, Rama, with joined palms, responded with firm determination,
'2': '"Following my father''s instructions, respecting his words, and due to the command of Sage Kaushika, it is my duty to carry it out without hesitation.'
'3': '"In Ayodhya, I was instructed by the noble-hearted King Dasharatha in the presence of my teachers, and his word must not be disregarded.'
'4': '"Having heard my father''s command and the instruction of the sage, I will indeed perform the best action of slaying Tataka without any doubt.'
'5': '"For the welfare of cows and Brahmanas, for the prosperity of the land, and for your own immeasurable cause, I am ready to fulfil your command."'
'6': Having spoken thus, the subduer of enemies, Rama, fastened his grip on the bow in its centre and produced a loud twang, echoing in all directions.
'7': Hearing that sound, the forest dwellers were terrified, and Tataka, enraged, was bewildered by the noise.
'8': Reflecting on that sound, the Yakshini, filled with anger, heard it and rushed towards the source, enraged.
'9': 'Seeing her approach in rage, her face distorted and monstrous in form, Rama spoke to Lakshmana:'
'10': '"Look, Lakshmana, at the dreadful and terrible form of this Yakshini. The hearts of the fearful would break merely at the sight of her.'
'11': '"See this invincible one, endowed with the power of illusion. Today, I will incapacitate her by taking off her ears and nose.'
'12': '"I do not wish to kill her, as she possesses the nature of a woman. However, I think I will subdue her power and mobility."'
'13': While Rama was speaking, Tataka, filled with rage, raised her arms and charged at Rama, roaring.
'14': The sage Vishwamitra, the Brahmarshi, rebuked her with a 'Hum' sound and blessed Rama and Lakshmana, saying, "May you be safe, and may you have victory."
'15': Stirring up a dense cloud of dust, Tataka enveloped both Raghavas, bewildering them for a moment with a thick cloud of dust.
'16': Assuming her illusory powers, she showered a massive downpour of stones on Rama and Lakshmana. Then Rama became angry.
'17': With his arrows, Rama intercepted the great shower of stones hurled by her and, with swift arrows, cut off her hands as she advanced.
'18': Then, as she stood, exhausted and roaring nearby with her arms severed, Lakshmana, in his anger, cut off her ears and nose.
'19': Assuming multiple forms, Yakshini, using her illusory powers, disappeared, deluding them by her illusion.
'20': Casting a shower of stones, she roamed around, terrifyingly. Then, Rama and Lakshmana were being pelted from all sides by the stone rain.
'21': Seeing this, the illustrious son of Gadhi (Vishwamitra) spoke, "Enough of this pity, Rama. She is wicked and evil by nature.
'22': '"She was once capable of creating obstructions for sacrifices by her illusory powers. She must be slain before the evening twilight approaches.'
'23': '"At twilight, Rakshasas becomes invincible, and she too will become stronger. Therefore, I urge you to slay this Yakshini now."'
'24': Thus instructed, Rama, aiming to demonstrate his accuracy by sound alone, struck her with his arrows while she continued her stone barrage.
'25': Enveloped in a net of arrows, she advanced, furious and swift like a thunderbolt, towards Rama and Lakshmana.
'26': Rama pierced her chest with an arrow, and she fell down dead. Seeing her fallen, resembling a terrible mountain,
'27': Lord Indra and all the gods praised Rama, saying, "Well done, well done, Kakutstha!" filled with great joy.
'28': 'Filled with delight, all the gods, along with Vishwamitra, addressed him: "O Sage Kaushika, may there be auspiciousness for you.'
'29': '"The sons of Krishashva, who are filled with true valour and the power of penance, should be imparted to Raghava, as he is deserving of such knowledge.'
'30': '"O Brahmana, for the great task that lies ahead, Rama should be instructed in the knowledge of those divine weapons. He is indeed worthy and devoted to following you."'
'31': Saying thus, all the gods departed, delighted, after honouring Vishwamitra, and the evening twilight began to set in.
'32': 'Then, the foremost of sages, pleased with the slaying of Tataka, blessed Rama and, kissing him on the forehead, spoke:'
'33': '"Let us stay here tonight, O Rama, the one with auspicious looks. Tomorrow morning, we shall proceed to my hermitage."'
'34': Hearing Vishwamitra's words, the son of Dasharatha, delighted, stayed there comfortably in the forest of Tataka.
'35': That very day, with the curse lifted, the forest, adorned beautifully, began to shine like the enchanting Chaitraratha forest.
'36': Having slain Tataka, the daughter of the Yaksha, Rama, praised by the assemblies of gods and Siddhas, stayed there with the sage, waiting to be awakened at dawn.
'-1': Thus is the 26th chapter in the Childhood Section of the Valmiki Ramayanam, named 'Slaying Tataka'.
