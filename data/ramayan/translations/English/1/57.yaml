'0': Now, in the Valmiki Ramayana, in the Bala Kanda, begins the sarga known as “Triśaṅku Yājñapraṇātha,” the seventy-fifth sarga.
'1': Then, with a heart ignited by passion and mindful of his own restraint, the great-souled one—endowed with unwavering valor—prepared himself for what was to come.
'2': Having proceeded southward accompanied by the illustrious maiden and Raghava, there approached the most formidable and dreadful ascetic, Vishvamitra, the embodiment of severe penance.
'3': Observing one who subsisted on the ‘fruits and roots’ of austerity—with his very determination manifest as if etched in his being—there then appeared the sons of Jajagire, steadfast in their devotion to truth and righteousness.
'4': Swift in his stride as if borne upon the flames of sacrificial fire, with eyes fixed in resolute determination and in the manner of a great warrior, he shone forth; as though having transversed a thousand years, he was venerated akin to Brahma, the exalted progenitor of all worlds.
'5': He then addressed Vishvamitra in sweet, melodious words, saluting him as the ascetic of profound penance, conqueror of the realms of kings and sages, O descendant of Kushika.
'6': By that very penance, we do recognize you as the royal sage; having thus spoken, the great-lumined one departed in the company of celestial beings.
'7': Triśaṅku—the exalted lord of Brahmaloka and supreme master of all realms—elicited a momentary mute awe in Vishvamitra, whose tongue grew somewhat silent upon hearing these words.
'8': Overwhelmed by deep sorrow, the youthful one spoke, declaring, 'Verily, you are known to me as the royal sage, distinguished by your most intense austerities.'
'9': I deem that neither the penances of the gods nor the assemblage of sages bear any fruitful yield; having firmly resolved thus in my heart, I address you, O mighty practitioner of supreme austerity.
'10': The ascetic—a paragon of righteousness, detached from worldly affections and endowed with a noble soul—is, at this very moment, recognized as one whose senses have been mastered and who speaks only the truth.
'11': Raghava then declared, 'You, renowned as Triśaṅku, the augmenter of the Ikṣvāku dynasty, possess an intellect divinely inspired for the performance of sacred sacrifices.'
'12': ‘Let us proceed,’ he continued, ‘with our very bodies toward the supreme destination of the deities.’ Thus, he summoned Vasishtha and, in a state of thoughtful concern, recounted his purpose.
'13': Addressed as ‘inconceivable’ by the great soul Vasishtha, he was, in consequence, disavowed by him and thus set out toward the southern direction.
'14': Thereafter, for the fulfillment of his ordained actions, the king’s sons accompanied him; for Vasishtha had long engaged in profound and rigorous austerities in that very region.
'15': Meanwhile, Triśaṅku, resplendent with great brilliance and radiating as if a hundredfold luminous, beheld the sons of Vasishtha—those ardent ascetics distinguished by their resolute zeal.
'16': Approaching the great soul, all the disciples of the revered Guru were respectfully saluted; yet he himself became somewhat reticent, his speech falling silent.
'17': Then that illustrious sage spoke with hands joined in reverence, declaring, 'I have taken refuge in you; I am entirely surrendered to those who are truly a haven.'
'18': For truly, the auspicious boon was not granted to you by the great soul Vasishtha; as one desirous of performing the grand sacrifice, you are most deserving of its sanction.
'19': Having bowed in deep obeisance to all the Guru’s sons, I, with my head bowed in humility, earnestly beseech those Brahmins who are steadfastly immersed in penance.
'20': May you, all of you, perform the sacred sacrifice with unwavering focus for my accomplishment, so that I, in my entirety, may secure the abode of the gods.
'21': Yet Vasishtha declared that the pathway of further austerity was not for you; for I see not even one among the Guru’s sons in your midst.
'22': For among all the Ikṣvāku descendants, the foremost are destined for the highest state; consequently, from this moment onward, may all of you become as divine as the deities themselves to me.
'-1': Thus concludes the sarga entitled “Triśaṅku Yājñapraṇātha” — the seventy-fifth sarga — in the Bala Kanda of the illustrious Valmiki Ramayana, the original epic.
