'0': And now, the 15th chapter in the Childhood Section of Valmiki Ramayanam, named 'Strategising Ravana's Downfall'.
'1': The wise sage, having meditated for a while, then regained his awareness and addressed the king versed in the Vedas with these words.
'2': “I will perform a sacrificial ritual for you, aimed at begetting sons, according to the prescribed methods with the mantras from the Atharva Veda.”
'3': Then, the radiant sage commenced the sacrificial ritual for the sake of offspring, offering oblations into the fire as per the prescribed rites and with mantras revealed in the scriptures.
'4': At that time, gods, Gandharvas, Siddhas, and great sages assembled to receive their share of the offerings, in accordance with the proper rites.
'5': The gods, assembled as per the custom, spoke to the creator Brahma in that assembly.
'6': “O revered one! Due to your grace, the Rakshasa named Ravana, through his might, harasses all of us, and we are unable to control him.”
'7': “When you were pleased, O Lord, you granted him a boon, and respecting that boon, we have endured everything from him.”
'8': “This wicked-minded one oppresses the three worlds and desires to overpower Indra, the king of the gods.”
'9': “Under the delusion of the boon he received, he troubles sages, Yakshas, Gandharvas, Brahmins, and Asuras.”
'10': “The sun does not scorch him, the wind does not blow near him, and even the ocean, with its turbulent waves, does not stir upon seeing him.”
'11': “O revered one, we are terrified of that dreadful Rakshasa! Please devise a way to destroy him.”
'12': Having heard the words of the gods, Brahma contemplated and then said, “Indeed, I now understand the means to destroy this wicked one.”
'13': “He was granted invulnerability from Gandharvas, Yakshas, gods, Danavas, and Rakshasas through my words, and I affirmed it.”
'14': “But out of disdain, he did not request protection from humans. Therefore, he is vulnerable to men, and no other means of his death exists.”
'15': Upon hearing these pleasing words from Brahma, the gods and sages were filled with joy.
'16': At that moment, the greatly radiant Vishnu, the lord of the world, holding a conch, discus, and mace, dressed in yellow robes, appeared.
'17': Mounted upon Garuda, the eagle, like the sun rising over the clouds, adorned with golden armlets, was praised by the best of the gods.
'18': Arriving there, he stood with great focus, and all the gods, bowing down and glorifying him, spoke to him.
'19': “We entrust you, O Vishnu, with the task of protecting the worlds. O Lord, you should be born as the son of King Dasharatha, the ruler of Ayodhya.”
'20': “That king, who is righteous, generous, and as radiant as the great sages, has three wives, each like modesty, prosperity, and fame embodied.”
'21': “O Vishnu, divide yourself into four forms and be born as his son. In that way, becoming a man, you can destroy Ravana, the tormentor of the worlds.”
'22': “Ravana, who cannot be slain by the gods, should be killed by you in battle, O Vishnu, for he torments gods, Gandharvas, Siddhas, and the best of sages.”
'23': “That Rakshasa, Ravana, deluded by his power, terrorises sages, Gandharvas, and Apsaras.”
'24': “While they were enjoying themselves in the Nandana grove, he violently attacked them, and for his destruction, we have come here with the sages.”
'25': “The Siddhas, Gandharvas, and Yakshas have sought refuge in you. O Vishnu, you are the supreme refuge for all of us.”
'26': “With the intention to protect the gods, O lord, set your mind on the destruction of that Rakshasa, along with his sons, grandsons, ministers, and kin.”
'27': Praised by the gods, the Lord Vishnu, the best of the celestials, then spoke to all the gods, led by Brahma, who were assembled there.
'28': “Abandon your fear; may good fortune be upon you. I will kill Ravana, along with his sons, grandsons, ministers and relatives in battle, to protect the worlds.”
'29': “Having slain that cruel, invincible, and fearsome foe of the gods and sages, I shall dwell in the world of men for ten thousand years and ten hundred years.”
'30': After granting this boon to the gods, the self-possessed Vishnu began to contemplate his place of birth in the human world.
'31': Then, the lotus-eyed Vishnu divided himself into four forms and chose King Dasharatha as his father.
'32': Then the gods, sages, Gandharvas, Rudras, and the hosts of Apsara, with divine hymns, praised the mighty Madhusudana.
'33': “O Vishnu, that pompous and arrogant Ravana, full of strength and hatred towards the lords of the gods, is a thorn to the sages and instills fear into their hearts. Uproot him.”
'34': “After killing Ravana, along with his army and kin, return to the heavenly world free of anxiety, guarded by Indra,  and free from any faults.”
'-1': Thus is the 15th chapter in the Childhood Section of the Valmiki Ramayanam, named 'Strategizing Ravana's Downfall'.
