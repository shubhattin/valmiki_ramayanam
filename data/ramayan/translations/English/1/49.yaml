'0': Now begins the Valmiki Ramayana in the Bala Kanda, the sarga entitled “Ahilya’s Curse-Remission” (sarga number forty‐nine), wherein the divine narrative unfolds with sacred purpose.
'1': Thereafter, Shakra advanced toward Agnipura among the gods and, with eyes distressed by apprehension, addressed the assembly of perfected Gandharvas and celestial singers.
'2': He declared, ‘While you, O illustrious Gautama, were immersed in deep austerities, I have introduced a disturbance; indeed, in a burst of wrath, I have set in motion this affair concerning the gods’ sacred work.’
'3': I, Afala, am the agent of this deed—wrought in anger—and by the power of curse-remission I have thereby nullified the fruit of his profound penance.
'4': O divine leaders, all you gods and the assembly of venerable seers, it is meet that you unite your efforts to accomplish this sacred commission with assured success.
'5': Upon hearing the words of the virtuous Shatakrata, the gods, proceeding toward Agnipura and accompanied by their ancestral deities along with the hosts of the Maruts, proclaimed in unison.
'6': Behold, this ram, endowed with horns and fashioned by Shakra himself as a horned being, had its majestic horns duly taken and promptly offered to Shakra.
'7': I, Afala, have prepared this very ram to confer the highest satisfaction; for your delight and for the benefit of those humble servants, you shall bestow upon them an inexhaustible and abundant reward.
'8': Then Agni, having hearkened to the command and joined by the ancestral deities, uncurtained the ram’s horn and, with the aspect of one marked by a thousand eyes, firmly established it.
'9': Following this, the Pitṛ deities, assembled with Kakutstha, partook of the fruits derived from the ram, thereby gathering its sacred benefits for themselves.
'10': Next, Indra, having taken the ram’s horn and accompanied by the illustrious Raghava, was deeply moved by the radiant effulgence of Gautama and by the sublime austerities of that great soul.
'11': Then the one imbued with great splendor promptly proceeded to the hermitage of virtuous deeds, seeking out the divine and blessed Ahilya, who, with her celestial form, had come to the aid of the gods.
'12': Hearing the counsel of the sage Vishwamitra, Raghava, along with his loyal companion Lakshmana, honored Vishwamitra and then entered the sacred ashram in proper reverence.
'13': In the ashram he beheld the blessed one, aglow with the radiance of penance, whose resplendent appearance attracted beings from all worlds, so that both gods and demons alike beheld her with awed admiration.
'14': Through diligent exertion, the divine architect had fashioned a wondrous form suffused with celestial mystery—an illusory beauty that shone forth like a blazing fire with a radiant, smoke-like splendor.
'15': Adorned with a garland of virtuous excellence and shining with the luster of a full moon, at its center burned an indomitable radiance comparable to the brilliant light of the sun.
'16': Indeed, by the injunction of Gautama, she became scarcely perceptible, awaiting the destined moment when Rama’s transcendent vision, spanning the three realms, would appear to consummate the termination of the curse.
'17': Then, overwhelmed with joy, Raghava gently clasped her feet, and she, ever mindful of Gautama’s sacred words, received his homage in graceful accord.
'18': In continued propriety, he offered a ritual gift for her feet and rendered formal hospitality, which was duly accepted by Kakutstha in accordance with the ordained rites.
'19': A magnificent cascade of blossoms ensued, accompanied by the sonorous strains of divine musicians, while both Gandharvas and Apsaras joined in a resplendent, joyous festival.
'20': The deities, exclaiming ‘Excellent, excellent!’ with heartfelt devotion, reverently worshipped the noble Ahilya—the embodiment of pure, potent penance as ordained by Gautama’s immutable command.
'21': Gautama himself, resplendent in lofty radiance and accompanied by Ahilya, joyfully honored Rama through the proper performance of sacred rites, exemplifying the depth of their penances.
'22': Likewise, Rama received the highest veneration from the revered sage Gautama; having duly performed the prescribed ceremonies, he then proceeded in person to Mithila.
'-1': Thus concludes the sarga of the Valmiki Ramayana’s Bala Kanda entitled “Ahilya’s Curse-Remission,” as presented in the ancient Adikavya, completing the sacred narrative with the final dispelling of the curse.
