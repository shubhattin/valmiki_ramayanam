'0': In the sacred Ramayana composed by the sage Valmiki, in the Balakanda, this is the forty-third sarga named "The Descent of the Ganga."
'1': When the lord of the gods had departed, O Rama, King Bhagiratha, pressing the earth with the tip of his thumb, performed penance for a year.
'2': At the end of the year, the lord of all beings, the revered consort of Uma, spoke to the king.
'3': '"I am pleased with you, O best of men. I shall do what is dear to you. I shall bear the daughter of the mountain king on my head."'
'4': Then the eldest daughter of the Himalayas, revered by all the worlds, assumed a form of immense size and unbearable speed.
'5': O Rama, she descended from the sky onto the auspicious head of Shiva, the lord of auspiciousness, and the divine Ganga, difficult to restrain, thought thus.
'6': '"I shall take Shankara with my current and enter the netherworld." Knowing her intention, the lord Hari became angry.'
'7': The three-eyed lord then resolved to make her disappear. She fell on the sacred head of Rudra, but could not find a way to the earth despite her efforts.
'8': O Rama, she wandered in the matted locks of Shiva, resembling the Himalayas, for many years, unable to find an exit.
'9': She could not find a way out of the matted locks and roamed there for many years.
'10': Then, seeing her again, the king, who was engaged in supreme penance, pleased Shiva greatly.
'11': Then Shiva released the Ganga towards the Bindusara. As she was being released, seven streams emerged.
'12': The three streams, Hladini, Pavani, and Nalini, flowed towards the east, carrying the sacred waters of Shiva.
'13': The other three, Suchakshu, Sita, and the great river Sindhu, flowed towards the west.
'14': The seventh stream followed the chariot of Bhagiratha. The royal sage Bhagiratha, mounted on a divine chariot, proceeded ahead with great splendor, followed by the Ganga.
'15': The Ganga, having descended from the sky and the head of Shankara, reached the earth.
'16': The water flowed there with a loud sound, accompanied by schools of fish, turtles, and groups of crocodiles.
'17': The earth shone with the falling and fallen waters. Then the gods, sages, gandharvas, yakshas, and siddhas beheld her descending from the sky to the earth.
'18': They stood there in their celestial vehicles, resembling cities, with horses and excellent elephants.
'19': The gods, with their immense splendor, gathered there to witness this wondrous descent of the Ganga.
'20': The sky, filled with the radiance of their ornaments, shone like a hundred suns without clouds.
'21': The sky appeared as if scattered with lightning, with the groups of crocodiles, serpents, and fish moving about.
'22': The sky was covered with white water lilies, resembling autumn clouds filled with flocks of swans.
'23': At times, it moved swiftly, at times crookedly, at times extended, at times bent, and at times slowly.
'24': The water, striking against water, rose upwards and then fell back to the earth.
'25': The water, having fallen from the head of Shankara, shone on the earth, pure and free from impurities.
'26': The groups of sages and gandharvas residing on the earth touched the water, considering it sacred as it had fallen from the body of Shiva.
'27': Those who had fallen from the sky to the earth due to a curse, after performing ablutions there, became free from impurities.
'28': Having been purified by that water, they returned to the sky and regained their own worlds.
'29': The world rejoiced, delighted by that radiant water. Having performed ablutions in the Ganga, Bhagiratha became free from impurities.
'30': The royal sage Bhagiratha, mounted on a divine chariot, proceeded ahead, followed by the Ganga.
'31': All the gods, along with the groups of sages, demons, danavas, and rakshasas, followed the chariot of Bhagiratha.
'32': The gandharvas, yakshas, kinnaras, and great serpents, along with all the apsaras, followed the chariot of Bhagiratha.
'33': All the aquatic creatures, pleased, followed the Ganga. Wherever King Bhagiratha went, the illustrious Ganga, the best of rivers, the destroyer of all sins, followed.
'34': Then the Ganga flooded the sacrificial ground of the great sage Jahnu, who was performing a sacrifice.
'35': Knowing her intention, the sage Jahnu, in anger, drank all the water of the Ganga, which was a great wonder.
'36': Then the gods, along with the gandharvas and sages, greatly astonished, worshipped the great sage Jahnu, the best of men.
'37': They requested him to release the Ganga, and he, pleased, released her from his ears. Therefore, the Ganga is known as Jahnavi, the daughter of Jahnu.
'38': The Ganga, following the chariot of Bhagiratha, reached the ocean and then entered the netherworld to accomplish his task.
'39': The royal sage Bhagiratha, with great effort, brought the Ganga and saw his ancestors, reduced to ashes, devoid of consciousness.
'40': Then, O best of the Raghus, the sacred water of the Ganga, having purified the heap of ashes, enabled them to attain heaven.
'-1': Thus ends the forty-third sarga named "The Descent of the Ganga" in the Balakanda of the holy Ramayana composed by the sage Valmiki.
