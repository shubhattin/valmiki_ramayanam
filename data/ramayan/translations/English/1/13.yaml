'0': And now, the 13th chapter in the Childhood Section of Valmiki Ramayanam, named 'Entering Ritual Grounds'.
'1': When the spring season had arrived again and a full year had passed, the valiant king set out to perform the horse sacrifice for the sake of progeny.
'2': The king bowed his head and reverently worshipped Vasishta before humbly addressing the best of Brahmins in order to have offspring.
'3': '"O Brahmin, let my sacrifice be performed according to the prescribed rites, so that no obstacles may arise in the proceedings."'
'4': '"You are my dear friend and supreme guide, and the responsibility of this great sacrifice lies with you."'
'5': The excellent Brahmin replied, "As you wish, O king, I will carry out everything as you have asked."
'6': Then, the king instructed the wise and elderly Brahmins, those well-versed in the sacrificial rites, as well as experienced builders and architects.
'7': He called upon skilled craftsmen, carpenters, diggers, sculptors, and artists, as well as dancers and performers.
'8': '"Gather learnt men, those skilled in the scriptures and in the sacrificial rituals, as per the king''s orders."'
'9': '"Let the bricks be gathered in thousands, and let the structures for the sacrifice be built with great care and excellence."'
'10': '"Let many hundreds of Brahmin residences be constructed, well-stocked with food, drink, and all necessities."'
'11': '"Also, make extensive arrangements for the citizens, as well as for kings coming from distant lands, each with their own accommodations."'
'12': '"Prepare stables for horses and elephants, as well as shelters for guards and foreign visitors."'
'13': '"Make sure that these places are well-stocked with food and that all the citizens are provided with delightful arrangements."'
'14': '"Food should be distributed respectfully, according to proper conduct, not carelessly, and all the varnas (classes) should be honoured with due respect."'
'15': '"Even those who are engaged in the construction and rituals, including artisans and workers, should not be treated with disdain."'
'16': '"They should be honoured appropriately with gifts and meals, according to the prescribed procedures."'
'17': '"Make sure that everything is well-organized, so that nothing is left incomplete. Perform all duties with a heart full of joy."'
'18': Then, all the assembled men approached Vasishta and said, "Everything has been arranged as instructed, and nothing has been left undone."
'19': '"We will carry out everything as ordered without leaving anything unfinished," they said, to which Vasishta then summoned Sumanta and spoke to him.'
'20': '"Invite all the righteous kings of the world, along with thousands of Brahmins, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas, and Shudras."'
'21': '"Bring people from all regions, showing them proper respect, especially the valiant King Janaka of Mithila, who always speaks the truth."'
'22': '"Bring him with great honor, for he is an earlier ally. That is why I first mention him to you."'
'23': '"Also, invite the king of Kashi, who is affectionate, always speaks kindly, is of noble conduct, and is divine in appearance."'
'24': '"Bring the elderly, highly righteous King of Kekaya, the father-in-law of the lion-like king, along with his sons."'
'25': '"Invite Romapada, the great archer and king of Anga, who is the dear friend of the lion-hearted king, along with his sons."'
'26': '"Also, bring the refined King Bhanumanta of Kosala and the brave, scholarly king of Magadha, who is skilled in all scriptures."'
'27': '"Convey the king''s orders to the great kings of the eastern regions, the Sindhu, Sauvira, and Saurashtra regions."'
'28': '"Invite the kings of the southern regions and any other kings on Earth who are affectionate and loyal."'
'29': '"Quickly bring all these kings, along with their entourages and families, through messengers of great merit."'
'30': Hearing Vasishta's words, Sumanta immediately gave instructions to his men to bring the invited kings.
'31': Sumanta himself, as a righteous man, hurriedly set out following the sage's orders to bring the great kings.
'32': Meanwhile, all the artisans and workers reported to the great sage Vasishta about all the preparations that had been made for the sacrifice.
'33': The excellent Brahmin, Vasishta, pleased with their work, instructed them, "Do not give anything carelessly or with disrespect, as it would harm the giver."
'34': In a few days, many kings arrived, bringing with them abundant treasure for King Dasharatha.
'35': Vasishta, greatly pleased, then addressed the king, "O King, the great kings have arrived at your command."
'36': '"I have duly honoured them all as befits their rank, and everything necessary for the sacrifice has been meticulously prepared."'
'37': '"Now you should proceed to the sacrificial ground, which has been beautifully adorned with all the desired offerings."'
'38': '"O King, come and see the sacrificial site, which looks as though it has been created by your own mind, perfectly arranged in every way."'
'39': Thus, following the words of Vasistha and Rishyashringa, the king (Dasharatha) set out on an auspicious day under a favourable constellation.
'40': Then, Vasistha, along with all the other eminent Brahmins, led by Rishyashringa, began the sacrificial rites.
'41': All of them proceeded to the sacrificial ground according to the prescribed rituals, and the illustrious king, accompanied by his wives, entered into the vows of initiation for the sacrifice.
'-1': Thus is the 13th chapter in the Childhood Section of the Valmiki Ramayanam, named 'Entering Ritual Grounds'.
