'0': And now, the 10th chapter in the Childhood Section of Valmiki Ramayanam, named 'Bringing Rshyashrnga to Anga'.
'1': 'Following the king''s command, Sumanta spoke these words: "Hear, O king, the story of how Rshyashrnga was brought here by the ministers. Let me narrate it to you and your ministers."'
'2': The chief priest, along with the ministers, said to King Romapada, "We have thought of a foolproof plan!"
'3': '"Rshyashrnga, the forest-dwelling sage, is engaged in austerities and study of the scriptures. He knows nothing of women or the pleasures of the world."'
'4': '"Through the use of enticing sensory objects, which can easily disturb the minds of men, we will quickly bring him to the city."'
'5': '"Let beautiful women, adorned in fine attire, go to him and entice him with various means. They will treat him with respect and bring him here."'
'6': The king, having heard this, agreed and instructed the chief priest and ministers to carry out the plan accordingly.
'7': "Hearing\_this,\_the\_chief\_courtesans\_ventured\_into\_the\_vast\_forest\_near\_the\_hermitage\_in\_search\_of\_the\_sage."
'8': The sage's son, who always stayed in the hermitage and was fully content following his father, had never left it.
'9': Since birth, the ascetic had not seen any other being—man, woman, or animal—from the city or kingdom.
'10': By coincidence, Vibhandaka's son arrived in that place and saw those beautiful women for the first time.
'11': Adorned in colourful attire, the charming women sang in melodious voices and approached the sage’s son, addressing him.
'12': '"Who are you, O Brahmana? What do you do here? We wish to know more about you. Why do you wander alone in this desolate forest? Please tell us."'
'13': The Sage’s son, who had never seen such beautiful women, was intrigued. From his heart arose a desire to tell them about his father.
'14': '"My father is Vibhandaka, and I am his biological son. I am known as Rshyashrnga, and I am known for my austerities and duties."'
'15': '"Our hermitage is nearby, O beautiful women. I shall offer you all proper hospitality according to the scriptures."'
'16': Hearing the sage’s son, all the women were pleased and decided to visit the hermitage. Together, they accompanied him there.
'17': When they arrived, the Sage’s son greeted them with hospitality, offering them water for washing their feet, fruits, and roots.
'18': Accepting the hospitality, the women were anxious to return, afraid of the sage's father and swiftly decided to depart.
'19': '"O Brahmana, here are some of our finest fruits. Please accept them, eat them without delay, and may you be blessed."'
'20': With great joy, all the women embraced him and gave him various sweet delicacies and treats.
'21': As he tried the delicacies, the radiant sage assumed they were simply fruits, unknowing that he had never experienced such things while living in the forest.
'22': After greeting the sage and explaining their visit, the women, still fearful of his father, quickly departed.
'23': After the women left, the son of Kashyapa became restless, his heart unsettled, and he found it hard to overcome his sorrow.
'24': The next day, the powerful son of Vibhandaka returned to the same place, constantly thinking about the women he had seen.
'25': The courtesans, seeing him approach, were delighted, and their hearts filled with joy.
'26': Approaching him, they said, "O gentle sage, please come with us to our place, our hermitage."
'27': '"There, you will find a variety of fruits and roots. Without a doubt, you will participate in numerous special rites.'
'28': Hearing their heartwarming words, the sage’s son decided to go with them, and the women led him away.
'29': As the great sage was being led away, the gods immediately sent rain upon the earth, bringing joy to all the beings.
'30': With the rains, the sage arrived, and King Romapada went out to greet him, bowing his head to the ground.
'31': With great respect, the king offered him water for washing his feet, and earnestly requested the sage’s forgiveness, fearing he might become angry.
'32': The king then led him to the inner chambers and, with a peaceful mind, offered his daughter Shanta to him in marriage according to the prescribed rites.
'33': Rshyashrnga, the great and radiant sage, lived there with his wife Shanta, honoured and worshiped, fulfilling all his desires.
'-1': Thus is the 10th chapter in the Childhood Section of Valmiki Ramayanam, named 'Rshyashrnga's Departure'.
