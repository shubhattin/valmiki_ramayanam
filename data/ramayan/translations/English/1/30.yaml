'0': And now, the 30th chapter in the Childhood Section of Valmiki Ramayanam, named 'Protecting the Yajna'.
'1': Then, those two princes, Rama and Lakshmana, who were knowledgeable of time and place and were adept at defeating adversaries, spoke to Vishwamitra at the appropriate time,
'2': '"O revered one, we wish to know the exact time when the two demons will arrive, so we may guard accordingly and not miss that moment."'
'3': Thus speaking, the eager-to-fight Kakutsthas (Rama and Lakshmana) were praised by all the sages, who were pleased with them.
'4': '"From today, guard the sacrificial ceremony for six nights, O Raghavas. This sage has taken a vow of consecration and will now observe silence."'
'5': Hearing this, the illustrious princes, staying awake for six days and nights, protected the hermitage and the sacrificial rites.
'6': With great vigilance, the two heroic and excellent archers kept watch, protecting the eminent sage Vishwamitra.
'7': Then, when the sixth day had arrived, Rama said to Lakshmana, "Be alert and attentive."
'8': While Rama was speaking, eager to fight, the sacrificial altar with its priests and officiating priests suddenly began to blaze.
'9': The altar, accompanied by Vishwamitra and the officiating priests, shone with darbha grass, ladles, vessels, and a pile of flowers.
'10': The sacrifice was proceeding with mantras in the prescribed manner, and a dreadful sound emerged in the sky.
'11': A cloud covered the sky, just like during the rainy season, and then the two Rakshasas approached, using their illusory powers.
'12': Maricha and Subahu, along with their followers, who were terrifying in appearance, arrived and began to pour down streams of blood.
'13': Seeing the sacrificial altar polluted with that flow of blood, Rama swiftly advanced and observed them in the sky.
'14': Seeing the two of them rushing in, the lotus-eyed Rama looked at Lakshmana and said,
'15': '"Look, Lakshmana, at those wicked Rakshasas who are eaters of flesh. I shall disperse them with the Manava weapon, just as the wind scatters clouds.'
'16': '"I have no doubt that I shall overpower them, but I do not wish to kill them." Saying this, Rama took up his bow and, with great speed,'
'17': fitted the supreme, radiant Manava Astra and, greatly enraged, aimed it at Maricha's chest.
'18': Struck by that supreme weapon, Maricha was hurled a hundred yojanas away into the ocean.
'19': Seeing Maricha swirling in the water, unconscious and struck by the force of the arrows, Rama said to Lakshmana,
'20': '"Look, Lakshmana, at how the Manava Astra, empowered by the cold arrows, has overpowered him without taking his life."'
'21': '"Now, I shall kill these remaining merciless Rakshasas, who are wicked in conduct, engaged in sinful acts, and who disturb the sacrifice, eating flesh."'
'22': Saying this, Rama quickly demonstrated his swiftness by wielding the great Agneya Astra (fire weapon) and aiming it at Subahu's chest.
'23': Struck by the weapon, Subahu fell to the ground, and with the Vayavya Astra (wind weapon), Rama, of great renown, killed the rest, bringing joy to the sages.
'24': Having slain all the Rakshasas who were disturbing the sacrifice, Rama, the delight of the Raghu dynasty, was worshipped by the sages, just as Indra was after his victory.
'25': When the sacrifice was completed, the great sage Vishwamitra, seeing the directions free from obstacles, spoke to Kakutstha,
'26': '"I am fulfilled, O mighty-armed one, for you have fulfilled the command of your teacher. This Siddhashrama has truly been established!" Praising Rama in this way, he, along with the two brothers, proceeded to perform the evening prayers.'
'-1': Thus is the 30th chapter in the Childhood Section of the Valmiki Ramayanam, named 'Protecting the Yajna'.
