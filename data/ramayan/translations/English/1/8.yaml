'0': And now, the 8th chapter in the Childhood Section of Valmiki Ramayanam, named 'Sumantra's Advice'.
'1': Though King Dasharatha, a righteous and great soul, possessed such power and virtue, he was still tormented by the absence of a son to continue his lineage.
'2': 'While reflecting on this, the wise king had a thought: "Why should I not perform the Ashvamedha (horse sacrifice) to obtain a son?"'
'3': Having firmly decided that a sacrifice must be performed, the virtuous and wise king consulted with his ministers, who were equally devoted and righteous.
'4': 'Then, the great and powerful king spoke to Sumantra, the foremost among his ministers: "Quickly summon all the sages and priests for me."'
'5': Acting swiftly, Sumantra, who was quick in action, gathered all the learnt sages who had mastered the Vedas and brought them to the king.
'6': He brought Suyajna, Vamadeva, Jabali, Kashyapa, and the chief priest Vasishta, along with many other great Brahmins.
'7': Honouring all of them, the righteous King Dasharatha spoke these gentle words filled with dharma and purpose.
'8': '"I find no happiness in my life as I long for a son. Therefore, it is my wish to perform the Ashvamedha sacrifice to fulfill this desire."'
'9': '"I desire to perform this sacrifice according to the prescribed rituals. Please contemplate how I might attain this wish."'
'10': Hearing these words, the Brahmins, led by Vasishta, were pleased and offered their approval, praising the king’s words.
'11': The Brahmins, all extremely delighted, said to King Dasharatha, "Let the preparations for the sacrifice begin, and let the horse be released."
'12': '"Let the sacrificial grounds be prepared on the northern bank of the Sarayu River. Without a doubt, O king, you will obtain the sons you desire."'
'13': '"Since this righteous thought has arisen in your mind for the sake of a son," they continued, "you will certainly be successful." Hearing this, the King was overjoyed.'
'14': 'With his eyes filled with joy, the king commanded his ministers: "Begin the preparations as directed by the great sages."'
'15': '"Release the horse under the supervision of capable priests, and prepare the sacrificial ground on the northern bank of the Sarayu River."'
'16': '"Ensure that all the rituals and ceremonies are performed correctly and without fault, as this great sacrifice can be successfully completed by the king."'
'17': '"Any mistake in this supreme sacrifice would be disastrous, as learnt sages and Brahma Rakshasas (demonic spirits) are always on the lookout for errors."'
'18': '"The one who performs a sacrifice without following the proper procedures is quickly destroyed. Therefore, let every effort be made to complete this sacrifice in the prescribed manner."'
'19': '"Ensure that all the necessary preparations are made, as you are all capable of fulfilling this task," said the king. The ministers, honoured by the king, agreed, saying, "It shall be done."'
'20': Hearing the king’s command, the learnt Brahmins, who were devoted to righteousness, praised the king and encouraged him with their blessings.
'21': The Brahmins then returned to their homes, having been dismissed by the king. After sending off the Brahmins, the king spoke to his ministers.
'22': '"Make all the arrangements for the sacrifice in accordance with the instructions of the priests," commanded the wise king to his assembled ministers.'
'23': After giving these instructions, the wise and noble king retired to his palace. There, he went to his beloved wives.
'24': He told his wives, "Prepare yourselves for the initiation ceremony, for I am performing the sacrifice for the sake of having sons." Hearing these loving words from their radiant lord, the faces of his wives shone like lotuses blooming after the end of winter.
'-1': Thus is the 8th chapter in the Childhood Section of the Valmiki Ramayanam, named 'Sumantra's Advice'.
