'0': And now, the 19th chapter in the Childhood Section of Valmiki Ramayanam, named 'Vishvamitra's Request'.
'1': Hearing these marvellous and elaborate words of the Lion among kings, the great and radiant Vishwamitra, his hair standing on end, spoke.
'2': “O Tiger among kings, your words are befitting and unparalleled on this earth, for you are born into a great lineage and are under the guidance of the sage Vasishta.”
'3': “What I am about to say is deeply embedded in my heart. Please make a firm resolution to fulfil this task, O Tiger among kings, and be true to your word.”
'4': “I have undertaken a strict vow for the success of a sacrifice, O foremost of men. However, two Rakshasas, capable of assuming any form at will, are causing obstacles.”
'5': “When I am about to complete the sacrifice after many ceremonies, these two Rakshasas, named Maricha and Subahu, powerful and well-trained, cause hindrances.”
'6': “They rain torrents of flesh and blood upon the sacrificial altar, and when the vow is desecrated in this manner, all my efforts go in vain.”
'7': “Exhausted by this, I have lost all enthusiasm and left that place. However, I am unable to release my anger, O king.”
'8': “This is the nature of my vow, and a curse cannot be used here. O tiger among kings, you must give me your eldest son, Rama, who is of true valour.”
'9': “Although he is still a youth with hair like a crow’s wings, he is brave, and with my protection and divine strength, he is capable of destroying those wicked Rakshasas.”
'10': “Moreover, I shall bestow great benefit upon him in many ways. Without a doubt, he will gain unparalleled fame in all three worlds.”
'11': “Those two Rakshasas will not be able to stand before Rama under any circumstances.”
'12': “No man, other than Rama, can kill those two evil Rakshasas, who are intoxicated with power and are already caught in the noose of death.”
'13': “O Tiger among kings, do not let your affection for your son obstruct you. I promise you, those two Rakshasas will be slain. Know this for certain.”
'14': “I know Rama to be a great soul with true valor. The great sage Vasishta and all these other ascetics can attest to this.”
'15': “If you desire to gain righteousness and supreme fame on earth, O king, then you should give Rama to me.”
'16': “If your ministers, led by Vasishta, give their consent, then you should release Rama to me, free from all attachment.”
'17': “For ten nights only will he be away, as that is the duration of the sacrifice. The time for the sacrifice cannot be delayed, O descendant of Raghu.”
'18': “Therefore, I ask you to act in this way. May you be blessed, and do not let your mind be consumed by sorrow.”
'19': Thus, having spoken these righteous and meaningful words, the great and wise Vishwamitra became silent.
'20': Hearing the auspicious words of Vishwamitra, the king of kings was struck with immense grief, trembling, and losing consciousness.
'21': Regaining his senses, he rose, filled with fear, and sat in deep sorrow.
'22': Having heard the sage's words, which tore at his heart and mind, the great and noble king, deeply troubled, was shaken from his seat.
'-1': Thus is the 19th chapter in the Childhood Section of the Valmiki Ramayanam, named 'Vishvamitra's Request'.
