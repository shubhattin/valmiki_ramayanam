'20': Romapada agreed to the wise king’s request and promised to send Shanta and her husband with him.
'21': He then spoke to the sage, "O sage, go to the city with your wife," and the sage replied to the king, "It shall be done."
'22': The sage, having been granted permission by the king, left with his wife. With affection in their hearts, the two kings embraced each other before parting.
