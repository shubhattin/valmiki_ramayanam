'6': There they saw a holy hermitage of sages with purified souls, who had been performing supreme austerities for many thousands of years.

'8': '"Whose sacred hermitage is this? Who lives here, O revered one? We wish to hear about it, as we are very curious."'
'9': Hearing their words, the eminent sage smiled and said, "Listen, Rama, to whom this hermitage once belonged.
'10': '"Kandarpa (the god of love), also called Kama by the wise, once assumed a form here. He disturbed the meditating Sthanu (Shiva), who was deeply engrossed in asceticism and austerities.'
'11': '"As Lord Shiva, accompanied by the Maruts (the wind gods), was returning after his marriage, the foolish Kama, with his wicked intent, dared to disturb him. Enraged, the great soul uttered a ''Hum'' sound.'

'13': '"The angry Lord of the gods then reduced Kama to a bodiless state. Since then, he has been known as ''Ananga'' (the bodiless one), O Rama.'
'14': '"This is the region called Anga, where Kama lost his body. Since then, the sacred hermitage has belonged to the disciples of the once-embodied Kama.'
'15': '"These sages here are devoted to righteousness, and they have no sin, O hero. The hermitage is thus pure, having once belonged to Kama.'
'16': '"Today, let us stay here, O Rama, in this beautiful and auspicious place between the two sacred rivers. Tomorrow we shall cross over.'
'17': '"Let us all enter this pure and holy hermitage, and comfortably spend the night here, free from any worries."'
