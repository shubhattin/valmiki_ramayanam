'0': And now, the 21st chapter in the Childhood Section of Valmiki Ramayanam, named 'Vasishtha's Counsel'.
'1': 'Hearing those affectionate and emotional words of his (the king), Sage Kaushika replied angrily to the king:'
'2': '"After promising a favour earlier, now you wish to abandon the pledge. Such a reversal is unworthy of the lineage of the Raghavas.'
'3': If this is acceptable to you, O King, I shall return the way I came. Remain happy, surrounded by your friends, as one who makes false promises, O descendant of Kakutstha.
'4': As the wise Vishwamitra, filled with rage, spoke thus, the entire earth trembled, causing great fear to the gods.
'5': 'Realising the fear in the whole world, the great sage Vasishtha, who was steadfast and virtuous, addressed the king:'
'6': '"Born in the lineage of Ikshvakus, you are as virtuous as Dharma himself. Steadfast, truthful, and glorious, it does not befit you to abandon righteousness.'
'7': The Raghava is renowned in all three worlds as righteous. Uphold your own dharma; you must not resort to unrighteousness.
'8': By failing to fulfil the promise you made, let the destruction of all your righteous deeds and religious activities occur. Therefore, let Rama depart.
'9': Whether skilled in weaponry or not, the Rakshasas cannot harm him, as he is protected by the son of Kushika, just like nectar guarded by fire.
'10': He is the embodiment of Dharma, the foremost among the valiant, superior in knowledge, and the culmination of austerity.
'11': He knows all kinds of weapons, both common and unique, throughout the animate and inanimate worlds of the three realms. No one else knows them, nor will they.
'12': Neither gods, sages, celestials, Rakshasas, Gandharvas, Yakshas, Kinnaras, nor great serpents know them.
'13': All the divine weapons were originally given to the exceedingly righteous Kaushika when he ruled the kingdom.
'14': Those weapons, the sons of Krishashva, born from Prajapati's lineage, are varied, powerful, and blazing, capable of bringing victory.
'15': Jaya and Suprabha, the daughters of Daksha, highly virtuous and beautiful, gave birth to a hundred brilliant weapons.
'16': Jaya received a boon and gave birth to fifty sons, incomparable and befitting, for the destruction of the armies of Asuras.
'17': Suprabha, too, gave birth to fifty sons again, known as Samharas, who are invincible, hard to conquer, and powerful.
'18': The son of Kushika knows all these weapons thoroughly and can create new ones as well, being proficient in Dharma.
'19': O Raghava, for the great sage of supreme knowledge, nothing is unknownâ€”neither past nor future.
'20': Such is the valour and mighty splendour of the renowned Vishwamitra, O King; there should be no doubt about sending Rama.
'21': Capable of restraining them himself, the son of Kushika earnestly seeks you out for the welfare of your son.
'22': Thus, due to the words of the sage, the mind of the illustrious King of the Raghus became pleased, and he happily agreed to send Rama with Kushika's son, who was famed and wise.
'-1': Thus is the 21st chapter in the Childhood Section of the Valmiki Ramayanam, named 'Vasishtha's Counsel'.
