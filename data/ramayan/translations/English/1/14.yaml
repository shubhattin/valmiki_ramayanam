'38': The Brahmins then cast the horse's limbs into the fire, completing the ritual for all its parts according to the prescribed rules.
'39': For other sacrifices, the oblations are made with the branches of the Plaksha tree, but for the Ashvamedha sacrifice, a portion is taken from the Vetasa tree.
'40': The Ashvamedha sacrifice is considered a three-day ritual by the Brahmins who follow the Kalpasutras.

'43': King Dasharatha, following tradition, gave the eastern direction to the Hota, the western to the Adhvaryu, and the southern to the Brahman priest.
'44': To the Udgata priest, he gave the northern direction, following the rules laid down for the great Ashvamedha sacrifice.
'45': After completing the sacrifice, King Dasharatha, the greatest of men, gave the entire earth to the priests as dakshina.
'46': Having made such a great gift, the illustrious King Dasharatha felt immense joy and contentment.
'47': The priests, however, refused the earth and told the king, "O protector of the earth, only you are worthy of ruling the entire world."
'48': '"We are devoted to study and austerity and are not capable of ruling the earth. Please give us something else instead."'
'49': '"Give us gold, jewels, cows, or anything else you deem fit, for we have no need of land."'
'50': Hearing the Brahmins' request, King Dasharatha, the best of men, gave them a hundred thousand cows.
'51': He also gave ten million pieces of gold and four times that amount of silver to the assembled priests.
'52': The great Brahmins, Rishyasringa and Vasishta, then divided the wealth fairly among themselves.
'53': They distributed the gold and other riches among the Brahmins and gave one hundred million golden coins to the poor.
'54': The compassionate King Dasharatha also gave the finest ornaments to a poor Brahmin who had requested them.
'55': After distributing gifts to all the Brahmins, the king, overcome with joy and respect, bowed to them.
'56': The Brahmins then blessed the generous and noble king with various benedictions.
'57': With a heart full of joy, King Dasharatha completed the great, sin-removing sacrifice, which was exceedingly difficult for other kings to accomplish.
'58': The king then approached Rishyasringa and requested, "O noble one, please help fulfill the wish of my lineage."
'59': Rishyasringa, the best of sages, replied, "O king, you will indeed have four sons who will uphold your dynasty."
'60': Hearing these sweet words, the great king Dasharatha reverently bowed to him and, with utmost joy, addressed Rishyashringa again.
'-1': Thus, is the 14th chapter in the Childhood Section of Valmiki Ramayanam, named 'Ashvamedha Yajna'.
