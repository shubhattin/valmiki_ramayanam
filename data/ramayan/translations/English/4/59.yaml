'0': Thus begins the sixty-first Sarga of the Kiskindha Kanda of the illustrious Valmiki Ramayana, entitled the Translation of the Peripheral Discourse.
'1': Thereupon, having expounded upon that immortal nectar of existence with words imbued with divine subtlety, King Gṛdhrarāja spoke, his utterance eliciting joyous admiration among the stalwart Plavaṅga warriors.
'2': Jambavān, the preeminent among the monkeys, together with all his Plavaṅga retainers, having sprung forth from the earth in one mighty surge, addressed King Gṛdhrarāja by name.
'3': Pray, tell me—by whose eyes has Sītā been seen, or by whose hand is she carried away, O noble one? Declare it forthwith, for such is the destined course of all the denizens of the forest abodes.
'4': Which among the bearers of Dasarathi’s arrows, whose shafts descend with thunderous speed, would not take heed of the valor of Lakshmana, extolled among the mighty?
'5': Recalling Hari and those dedicated to the annals of Sītā’s renown, he consoled them once more with words of deep affection and earnest reassurance.
'6': Listen, O Vaidehī, to the account of my own abduction as it is recounted—by which even I have come to know the place where no enchanting gaze was thus bestowed.
'7': I, who for many yojanas have trodden upon this formidable mountain, am an aged and weary soul, long fallen and depleted of erstwhile valiant life-force.
'8': That very son, ever my steadfast companion from the beginning, now sustains me with timely provisions, supporting me as ordained by fate.
'9': We, possessed of desires as keen as those of the Gandharvas and anger as piercing as that of coiled serpents, akin to the vigilant gazelles, are driven by an acute and unyielding hunger.
'10': In a moment when hunger pressed upon him, and as the sun sank beyond the horizon, my son—ever prompt and without hesitation—arrived, his purpose clear and resolute.
'11': Suffering from the hindrance in securing my sustenance and burdened by growing grief, he, having discerned the truth by his keen insight, spoke these words in earnest.
'12': I, overwhelmed by the pangs of hunger at the destined hour and borne away by fate, sought shelter by encircling the gateway of Mahendra’s mountain, secure in divine refuge.
'13': There, among the multitudes of thousands traversing the vast ocean of existence, a single path was resolutely chosen—set firm in its purpose to bar all dissenting counsel.
'14': There, I beheld one whose radiance rivaled the brilliance of the dawn; accompanied by his beloved wife, he advanced, his appearance reminiscent of scattered adornments of collyrium.
'15': Observing those two with the intent of meaningful engagement, I resolved with unwavering determination, and thus, guided by that gracious and humble preceptor, I followed the path laid out before me.
'16': Verily, no redeemer exists among those who are assembled here on earth; nor among the common multitude does anyone measure up in martial prowess as you do.
'17': Thereafter, he departed, his brilliance igniting the heavens with a swift, enveloping radiance; and I, accompanied by those borne of the noble steeds, gained entry into the assembly.
'18': The venerable sage proclaimed, 'Sītā lives,' and in a mysterious yet assuring manner, the gathered assembly was filled with confidence, their doubts entirely dispelled.
'19': Having thus spoken in the company of the accomplished and illustrious, I was apprised of the tidings—and even Rāvaṇa, the exalted king of demons, was made known to me.
'20': Gazing upon Dasaratha’s queen, the daughter of Janaka and consort of Rama, I beheld her with ornaments dishevelled and her countenance overpowered by the swift currents of grief.
'21': The names of Rama and Lakshmana resounded in exultant cries from unburdened voices, for he is extolled by the sages of sacred utterance as one who transcends the confines of time.
'22': To this end, all my devoted companions apprised me in full, and upon hearing, my mind remained resolute and undaunted, ever fortified by valor.
'23': For how could any mere bird initiate such an undertaking? Yet, what lies within my power, endowed with the virtues of eloquence and wisdom, I shall assuredly accomplish.
'24': Attend now, as I expound upon the foundation of your heroic valor; for among all men endowed with refined speech, I shall bestow upon you that which is most dear.
'25': If the endeavor concerning Dasaratha is indeed my charge, then there is no doubt, for you are the foremost in wisdom, mighty in strength, and imbued with an unyielding spirit.
'26': They were dispatched under the authority of the monkey-king, their orders resounding even among the formidable deities; and the arrows of Rama and Lakshmana were likewise set forth, imbued with invincible resolve.
'27': Throughout the three worlds, numerous formidable arms lie in wait for defense; and indeed, the ten-headed one, resplendent in power and brilliance, stands poised—yet for you, O capable and mighty ones, nothing is insurmountable.
'28': Let this resolve be forged in the crucible of time, that your determination may be steadfast; for in all undertakings, none can compare with you, O wise and capable guardians.
'-1': Thus concludes the translation of the Peripheral Discourse in the Kiskindha Kanda of the venerable Valmiki Ramayana, the ancient epic, being the sixty-first Sarga.
