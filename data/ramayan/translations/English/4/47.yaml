'12': “We have explored all the caves that were mentioned, as well as the thick undergrowth covered with vines.”
'13': “We have thoroughly searched the impassable, dangerous, and dense regions. All living creatures, even of extraordinary size, were found and defeated. These dense regions have been repeatedly explored.”
'14': '"The noble and valorous Hanuman, born of a distinguished lineage, will surely find Maithili. The son of the wind-god, Hanuman, will take the direction that Sita went."'
