'1': Then, having reached the mountain Prasravana, adorned with beautiful forests, they bowed their heads in reverence to Rama and the mighty Lakshmana.
'2': Placing the crown prince Sugriva at the forefront, they offered their salutations and began to convey the news of Sita.
'3': They spoke of her captivity in Ravana's inner chambers, the threats from the demonesses, her unwavering love for Rama, and the vow she had taken.
'4': Having narrated all this in the presence of Rama, the monkeys informed him that Vaidehi was unharmed. Hearing this, Rama responded.
'5': '"Where is the divine Sita residing, and how does she fare in relation to me? Tell me everything concerning Vaidehi, O monkeys."'
'6': Upon hearing Rama's words, the monkeys, in his presence, urged Hanuman, who was knowledgeable about Sita's situation, to speak.
'7': Hearing their words, Hanuman, the son of the wind god, bowed his head in reverence towards the direction of the divine Sita.
'8': The eloquent Hanuman then began to speak of how he had seen Sita, and he presented the divine golden jewel, shining with its own brilliance, to Rama.
'9': After giving the jewel to Rama, Hanuman, with folded hands, spoke, "Having crossed the ocean, a hundred yojanas wide, I went in search of Janaki, eager to see her."
'10': '"There, in the city of Lanka, belonging to the wicked Ravana, situated on the southern shore of the ocean, I found Sita."'
'11': '"She resides on the southern shore, and there I saw her, in Ravana''s inner chambers, maintaining her devotion to you, Rama, living on the hope of your return."'
'12': '"I saw her amidst the demonesses, being threatened repeatedly, yet she remains devoted to you, O Rama, accustomed to comfort."'
'13': '"Guarded by hideous demonesses in the pleasure garden, the divine lady suffers, though she is accustomed to happiness with you, O hero."'
'14': '"Confined in Ravana''s inner chambers, well-guarded by demonesses, she wears a single braid, looking forlorn, her mind absorbed in thoughts of you."'
'15': '"Lying on the ground, her body pale like a lotus in winter, she has renounced any desire for Ravana, resolved to die."'
'16': '"Somehow, O descendant of Kakutstha, I found the divine lady, her mind fixed on you, and slowly spoke of the glory of the Ikshvaku lineage."'
'17': '"Gradually, I gained her trust, and then the divine lady spoke to me, revealing everything."'
'18': '"Hearing of the alliance between Rama and Sugriva, she was filled with joy, her conduct always virtuous, and her devotion to you unwavering."'
'19': '"Thus, O best of men, I saw the illustrious daughter of Janaka, endowed with severe penance and devotion to you."'
'20': '"She gave me a token of recognition, recounting the incident with the crow at Chitrakuta, O wise Raghava."'
'21': '"Janaki instructed me to convey everything I had seen to you, O son of the wind, in detail."'
'22': '"This jewel, well-guarded by me, is to be given to you, as I speak these words in the presence of Sugriva."'
'23': '"This illustrious jewel, carefully preserved by me, is to be given to you, and she asked me to remind you of the mark of vermilion on her forehead."'
'24': '"This radiant jewel, born of water, is presented to you by me. Seeing it, I shall rejoice, as if seeing you in distress, O sinless one."'
'25': '"I shall sustain my life for a month, O son of Dasaratha. Beyond a month, I shall not live, having fallen into the hands of the demons."'
'26': '"Thus spoke Sita to me, her body emaciated, following the path of righteousness, confined in Ravana''s inner chambers, her eyes wide like a frightened doe."'
'27': '"This is all I have narrated, O Raghava, as it happened. In every way, a means to cross the ocean should be devised."'
'28': Knowing that the two princes were reassured, and having given the token of recognition to Raghava, the son of the wind narrated everything in detail, as told by the divine lady.
'-1': Thus ends the sixty-fifth sarga, named 'The Presentation of the Crest Jewel,' in the Sundara Kanda of the glorious Ramayana of Valmiki, the first epic.
