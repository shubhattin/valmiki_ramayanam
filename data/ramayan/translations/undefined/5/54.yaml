'0': Thus begins the fifty-fourth chapter of the Sundara Kanda in the glorious Ramayana composed by sage Valmiki, titled 'The Burning of Lanka'.
'1': Then, the monkey, having fulfilled his desire, gazed upon Lanka. His enthusiasm growing, he contemplated the remaining task.
'2': What indeed remains for me to do here at present, that would further cause distress to these Rakshasas?
'3': The forest has been ravaged, the prominent Rakshasas slain, a portion of the army destroyed; what remains is the destruction of the fortress.
'4': With the fortress destroyed, the task would be easily accomplished. With little effort in this task, my labor would bear fruit.
'5': This fire that burns on my tail, it is just to satisfy it with these excellent houses.
'6': Then, with his tail ablaze, like a cloud with lightning, the great monkey roamed the rooftops of Lanka.
'7': The monkey, fearless, moved from house to house of the Rakshasas, and through the gardens and palaces.
'8': Leaping with great speed, he entered the abode of Prahasta, and there he placed the fire, strong as the wind.
'9': Then, the valiant Hanuman leapt to the mansion of Mahaparsva, releasing a fire like the flame of the final dissolution.
'10': The great monkey then leapt to the abodes of Vajradamstra, Shuka, and the wise Sarana.
'11': Thus, the leader of the monkeys set fire to the house of Indrajit, and then to the mansion of Jambumali and Sumali.
'12': He set fire to the house of Rashmiketu, and likewise to that of Suryashatru, Hrasvakarn, Damstra, and the Rakshasa Romasha.
'13': He set fire to the houses of the Rakshasas Yuddhonmatta, Matta, Dhvajagriva, Vidyujjihva, and Hastimukha.
'14': He set fire to the houses of the Rakshasas Karala, Vishala, Shonitaksha, Kumbhakarna, and Makaraksha.
'15': He set fire to the houses of the evil-minded Narantaka, Kumbha, Nikumbha, Yajnashatru, and Brahmashatru.
'16': The great Hanuman, leaving aside the house of the mighty Vibhishana, systematically set fire to the rest.
'17': In those magnificent houses, the illustrious monkey set fire to the wealth of the wealthy.
'18': Having surpassed all, the valiant one reached the abode of the king of the Rakshasas, Ravana.
'19': Then, in that principal house, adorned with various jewels, resembling Mount Meru and Mandara, and adorned with various auspicious objects.
'20': Releasing the blazing fire from the tip of his tail, the heroic Hanuman roared like a cloud at the end of the age.
'21': With the wind's aid, the mighty fire blazed fiercely, growing like the fire of dissolution.
'22': The wind carried the blazing fire through those mansions, adorned with golden nets and made of pearls and gems.
'23': The great mansions, filled with jewels, crumbled. Those with broken towers fell to the ground.
'24': Like the abodes of the Siddhas falling from the sky at the end of their merit, a tumultuous sound arose from the fleeing Rakshasas.
'25': In their own homes, trying to protect them, their enthusiasm broken, their splendor gone, they cried, 'Surely this fire has come in the form of a monkey!'
'26': Women, holding their infants, suddenly fell, some with their bodies engulfed in flames, their hair disheveled, from the mansions.
'27': Falling, they shone like lightning from the clouds, amidst the clusters of diamonds, coral, cat's eye, pearls, and silver.
'28': He saw the various minerals flowing from the mansions. Just as fire is never satisfied with wood and grass,
'29': Hanuman is not satisfied with the destruction of the Rakshasas. The earth is not satisfied with the Rakshasas slain by Hanuman.
'30': By the great-souled, swift Hanuman, the city of Lanka was burnt, like Tripura by Rudra.
'31': Then, the fierce fire, with terrifying prowess, rose on the peak of the mountain of Lanka,
'32': Spreading its blazing halo, fanned by Hanuman's speed, it grew like the fire at the end of the age, reaching the sky.
'33': The great fire, with the brilliance of a million suns, surrounded all of Lanka,
'34': With many sounds, like those of thunderbolts, it seemed to split the egg of the universe.
'35': There, from the sky, the greatly increased fire, with a harsh glow, with a crest of Kimshuka flowers,
'36': With clouds filled with smoke, like blue lotuses, shone brightly.
'37': Is this Indra, wielder of the thunderbolt, or the lord of the gods, or Yama, or Varuna, or the wind,
'38': Or the fierce fire, or the sun, or Kubera, or the moon? This is not a monkey, it is Time itself.
'39': Is this the wrath of Brahma, the creator of the world, the four-faced lord of all beings,
'40': Having come here in the form of a monkey to destroy the Rakshasas?
'41': Is this the supreme, brilliant Vishnu, having assumed the form of a monkey to destroy the Rakshasas,
'42': The inconceivable, unmanifest, infinite one, having come now by his own illusion?
'43': Thus spoke many distinguished Rakshasas, gathered there,
'44': Seeing the city, with its beings, houses, and trees, suddenly burnt.
'45': Then, Lanka, suddenly burnt, with its Rakshasas, horses, chariots, elephants,
'46': With its flocks of birds, animals, and trees, cried out pitiably, with a tumultuous sound.
'47': '''Alas, father! Alas, son! Beloved! Friend! Alas, life! Our great merit is destroyed!'''
'48': Thus, the Rakshasas cried out in many ways, creating a terrible, fearsome sound.
'49': Covered with the flames of fire, its heroes slain, its warriors turned back,
'50': Overcome by the power of Hanuman's wrath, Lanka appeared as if cursed.
'51': Hanuman, of great mind, saw Lanka, with its Rakshasas terrified and dejected,
'52': Marked by the blazing flames, like the earth afflicted by the wrath of the self-existent one.
'53': Having destroyed the forest filled with precious trees, having slain the great Rakshasas in battle,
'54': Having burnt the city adorned with rows of precious houses, Hanuman, the son of the wind, stood there.
'55': Having slain many Rakshasas, having destroyed the forest with many trees,
'56': Having set fire to the Rakshasas' houses, the great-souled one went to Rama in his mind.
'57': Then, the foremost of monkey heroes, the mighty one, with the speed of the wind,
'58': The great-minded son of the wind, was praised by all the hosts of gods.
'59': All the gods, the foremost of sages, the Gandharvas, Vidyadharas, and serpents,
'60': All the great beings there experienced supreme, unparalleled joy.
'61': Having destroyed the forest, having slain the Rakshasas in battle,
'62': Having burnt the terrible city of Lanka, the great monkey shone.
'63': Standing on the peak of the best of houses, adorned with various jewels,
'64': The lion among monkeys, with a garland of flames from his blazing tail, shone like the sun with its garland of rays.
'65': Having oppressed all of Lanka, the great monkey extinguished the fire on his tail in the ocean.
'66': Then, the gods, along with the Gandharvas, Siddhas, and great sages,
'67': Seeing Lanka burnt, were filled with great wonder.
'68': Seeing the foremost of monkeys, Hanuman, the great monkey,
'69': All beings thought of him as the fire of Time.
'-1': Thus ends the fifty-fourth chapter of the Sundara Kanda in the glorious Ramayana composed by sage Valmiki, titled 'The Burning of Lanka'.
