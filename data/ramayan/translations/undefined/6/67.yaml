'0': In the great epic of Valmiki Ramayana, in the Yuddha Kanda, the sixty-seventh chapter is named the "Slaying of Kumbhakarna."
'1': Hearing the words of Angada, the mighty Vanaras, filled with the desire for battle, resolved firmly in their minds and returned to the battlefield.
'2': Their valor aroused, their courage mounted, and they were established in their resolve by the powerful words of Angada.
'3': The Vanaras, having decided to give up their lives, went forth with joy and engaged in a tumultuous battle.
'4': Then, the mighty Vanaras, quickly uprooting large trees and mountains, rushed towards Kumbhakarna.
'5': Kumbhakarna, filled with great anger, wielded his mace and began to scatter the enemies all around with his immense strength.
'6': Seven hundred and eighty thousand Vanaras, struck by Kumbhakarna, lay scattered on the ground.
'7': Encircling them with his arms, he devoured them, running about in great anger, like Garuda devouring serpents.
'8': With great difficulty, the Vanaras, regaining their composure, gathered from all sides, stood firm in the midst of the battle, holding trees and mountains.
'9': Then, the mighty Dwivida, uprooting a mountain, rushed towards Kumbhakarna like a cloud with a hanging peak.
'10': The Vanara, having uprooted it, hurled it at Kumbhakarna, but it fell upon his army without reaching the mighty Kumbhakarna.
'11': It crushed horses, elephants, and the best of chariots, as well as other Rakshasas, and another peak of the mountain.
'12': The battlefield, struck by the force of the mountain, became covered with blood, with horses slain, charioteers killed, and Rakshasas drenched in blood.
'13': The Rakshasas, with terrifying roars, suddenly severed the heads of the roaring Vanara leaders with arrows resembling the end of time.
'14': The great Vanaras, uprooting large trees, destroyed the chariots, horses, elephants, camels, and Rakshasas.
'15': Hanuman, standing in the sky, showered mountain peaks, various rocks, and trees upon the head of Kumbhakarna.
'16': Kumbhakarna, with his mighty strength, pierced those mountain peaks with his spear and broke the shower of trees.
'17': Then, wielding a sharp spear, he rushed towards the fierce army of the Vanaras, while Hanuman stood in front of him, holding a mountain peak.
'18': Enraged, Hanuman struck Kumbhakarna with great speed using the formidable mountain peak, causing him to tremble, his body drenched in blood.
'19': Wielding a spear that shone like lightning, Kumbhakarna struck Hanuman between his arms, like Guha striking Krauncha with a fierce weapon.
'20': Pierced between his mighty arms by the spear, Hanuman, vomiting blood from his mouth, roared fiercely in the great battle, like the thunder of a cloud at the end of an age.
'21': Seeing him distressed, the Rakshasa troops suddenly rejoiced, while the Vanaras, filled with fear, fled from Kumbhakarna in the battle.
'22': Then, the powerful Neela, organizing the army, hurled a mountain peak at the wise Kumbhakarna.
'23': Seeing it coming, Kumbhakarna struck it with his fist, and the mountain peak, struck by the blow, shattered, falling to the ground with sparks and flames.
'24': Rishabha, Sharabha, Neela, Gavaksha, and Gandhamadana, the five foremost Vanaras, attacked Kumbhakarna.
'25': With mountains, trees, palms, feet, and fists, the mighty Vanaras struck the great-bodied Kumbhakarna from all sides in the battle.
'26': Feeling the blows like mere touches, Kumbhakarna was not distressed. He embraced the mighty Rishabha with his arms.
'27': Crushed by the arms of Kumbhakarna, the mighty Vanara Rishabha fell, blood streaming from his mouth.
'28': Killing Sharabha with his fist, striking Neela with his knee, and hitting Gavaksha with his palm, the enemy of Indra struck Gandhamadana with his foot in anger.
'29': Struck by the blows, covered in blood, they fainted and fell to the ground like severed Kimshuka trees.
'30': With those great Vanaras fallen, thousands of Vanaras rushed towards Kumbhakarna.
'31': All the mighty Vanaras, resembling mountains, climbed upon him, leaped, and bit him with great strength.
'32': With nails, teeth, fists, and arms, the mighty Vanaras struck the great-armed Kumbhakarna.
'33': Covered by thousands of Vanaras, the Rakshasa tiger, resembling a mountain, shone like a mountain with its own trees.
'34': Grabbing all the Vanaras with his arms, the mighty Kumbhakarna devoured them in anger, like Garuda devouring serpents.
'35': Thrown into the mouth of Kumbhakarna, resembling the netherworld, the Vanaras came out through his nostrils and ears.
'36': The mighty Rakshasa, resembling a mountain, devoured all the Vanaras in great anger, breaking them in his wrath.
'37': Making the ground wet with flesh and blood, the Rakshasa moved among the Vanara army like a raging fire.
'38': Holding a spear like Indra with his thunderbolt, like Yama with his noose, Kumbhakarna shone in the battle with great strength.
'39': Just as fire burns dry forests in summer, Kumbhakarna burned the Vanara armies.
'40': Then, the Vanaras, being slaughtered, their troops destroyed, filled with fear, cried out with terrible voices.
'41': Being slaughtered in many ways by Kumbhakarna, the Vanaras, distressed and with scattered minds, sought refuge in Raghava.
'42': Seeing the Vanaras broken, the son of the wind god, Hanuman, thought, "What should I do now that Sugriva has been captured?"
'43': Grabbing a large mountain peak, roaring repeatedly, he frightened all the Rakshasas following Kumbhakarna.
'44': He hurled the mountain peak at the head of Kumbhakarna, striking him on the head with the mountain peak.
'45': Kumbhakarna, blazing with great anger, rushed towards the son of Vali with great speed.
'46': Kumbhakarna, with a great roar, frightening all the Vanaras, hurled his spear in anger at the mighty Angada.
'47': The mighty Vanara, skilled in the ways of battle, swiftly evaded the approaching spear with agility.
'48': Leaping up, he struck Kumbhakarna on the chest with his palm, causing him to faint with anger, like a mountain.
'49': Regaining consciousness, the mighty Rakshasa, grabbing a fist, hurled it away, and fell unconscious.
'50': Seeing the mighty Vanara fallen unconscious on the ground, Kumbhakarna, grabbing his spear, rushed towards Sugriva.
'51': Seeing the mighty Kumbhakarna rushing towards him, the heroic Sugriva, the king of the Vanaras, leaped up.
'52': Lifting a mountain peak, the great Vanara swung it and rushed towards the mighty Kumbhakarna with great speed.
'53': Seeing the Vanara rushing towards him, Kumbhakarna stood with all his limbs turned, facing the king of the Vanaras.
'54': Seeing Kumbhakarna, smeared with the blood of the Vanaras, devouring the great Vanaras, Sugriva spoke these words.
'55': '"The heroes have been slain by you, a great deed has been accomplished, the armies have been devoured, and you have attained great fame.'
'56': Leave the Vanara army, what will you do with the ordinary ones? Endure a single blow from this mountain, O Rakshasa!"
'57': Hearing the words of the king of the Vanaras, filled with courage and firmness, the Rakshasa tiger Kumbhakarna spoke.
'58': '"You are the grandson of Prajapati and the son of Riksharaja, endowed with courage and valor, therefore you roar, O Vanara!"'
'59': Hearing the words of Kumbhakarna, Sugriva, swiftly swinging the mountain, hurled it at Kumbhakarna's chest.
'60': The mountain peak, shattered by the blow, fell between his vast arms, and the Vanaras suddenly despaired, while the Rakshasas rejoiced with delight.
'61': Struck by the mountain peak, Kumbhakarna, filled with anger, roared, opening his mouth wide, and hurled his spear with the speed of lightning to slay the lord of the Vanaras.
'62': The sharp spear, hurled by Kumbhakarna, with a golden shaft, was swiftly seized by Hanuman, who broke it with his hands.
'63': The great iron spear, weighing a thousand Bharas, was broken by the delighted Vanara, placing it on his knee.
'64': Seeing the spear broken by Hanuman, the Vanara army, delighted, roared repeatedly and rushed from all sides.
'65': The Rakshasa, terrified, turned away, and the forest-dwelling Vanaras, roaring like lions, honored Hanuman, seeing the spear thus broken.
'66': Seeing the spear broken, the great Rakshasa king, filled with anger, uprooted a peak from the Malaya mountain in Lanka and struck Sugriva with it.
'67': Struck by the mountain peak, the mighty Vanara king fell unconscious to the ground in the battle, and seeing him fallen, the delighted Rakshasas roared in the battle.
'68': Approaching the mighty Vanara king, Kumbhakarna, with wondrous and terrible valor, seized Sugriva, carrying him away like a fierce wind carrying a cloud.
'69': Carrying him, resembling a great cloud, Kumbhakarna, in the battle, shone like Mount Meru with its terrible peaks.
'70': Then, carrying him, the heroic Rakshasa king, praised in the battle, heard the cries of the celestial beings, amazed at the capture of the Vanara king.
'71': Carrying the Vanara king, who was like Indra in valor, the enemy of Indra thought, "With him slain, all this will be destroyed, along with Raghava's army."
'72': Seeing the Vanara army scattered here and there, and Sugriva captured by Kumbhakarna,
'73': the wise Hanuman, the son of the wind god, thought, "What should I do now that Sugriva has been captured?"
'74': '"What is just for me to do, I shall do without doubt. Becoming like a mountain, I shall destroy the Rakshasa."'
'75': '"When I have slain the mighty Kumbhakarna in battle, his body shattered by my fists, and freed the Vanara king, let the Vanaras be delighted."'
'76': '"Or perhaps this Vanara will himself attain freedom, even if he is captured by the gods, along with the Asuras and serpents."'
'77': '"I think the Vanara king is not yet aware of himself, struck by the mountain blow of Kumbhakarna in the battle."'
'78': '"In a moment, Sugriva will regain consciousness in the great battle and will do what is beneficial for himself and the Vanaras."'
'79': '"If I free the great Sugriva, it will cause displeasure and eternal loss of fame."'
'80': '"Therefore, I shall wait for a moment for his valor to be displayed, and meanwhile, I shall reassure the scattered Vanara army."'
'81': Thus thinking, Hanuman, the son of the wind god, once again reassured the great army of the Vanaras.
'82': Kumbhakarna, carrying the great Vanara, entered Lanka, being honored with showers of excellent flowers from the celestial chariots, houses, and towers.
'83': Sprinkled with showers of parched grains and fragrant powders, slowly, due to the coolness of the royal path, the mighty one regained consciousness.
'84': Then, regaining consciousness with difficulty, being held between the mighty arms of Kumbhakarna, he looked around the royal path of the city and thought repeatedly.
'85': '"How can I, being captured, act now? I shall act in such a way that it will be desirable and beneficial for the Vanaras."'
'86': Then, suddenly, with his fingertips, the king of the Vanaras, biting the ears and nose of the enemy of Indra, tore his sides with his feet.
'87': Kumbhakarna, with his ears and nose torn, wounded by the teeth and nails of Sugriva, overwhelmed with anger, hurled Sugriva to the ground.
'88': Crushed on the ground by the mighty Rakshasa, being struck by them, he leaped into the sky like a ball and returned to Rama.
'89': Kumbhakarna, deprived of his ears and nose, covered in blood, shone like a mountain with streams.
'90': The mighty Rakshasa, drenched in blood, terrifying to behold, once again made up his mind for battle.
'91': Overcome with anger, spewing blood, the younger brother of Ravana shone like a cloud at sunset, resembling a mass of blue collyrium.
'92': Then, the enemy of the king of the gods, filled with anger, rushed again to the battle, thinking, "I am without a weapon," and seized a terrible mace.
'93': Then, suddenly emerging from the city, the mighty Rakshasa, Kumbhakarna, devoured the fierce Vanara army in the battle, like the fire at the end of an age consuming creatures.
'94': Hungry, desiring flesh and blood, entering the fierce Vanara army, Kumbhakarna, in his delusion, devoured Rakshasas, Vanaras, Pisachas, and bears in the battle, just as death takes away at the end of an age.
'95': In his anger, he seized one, two, three, or many Vanaras along with Rakshasas, and quickly threw them into his mouth with one hand.
'96': The mighty one, with fat and blood flowing, being struck by the peaks of mountains, devoured the Vanaras.
'97': The Vanaras, being devoured, then went to Rama for refuge, while Kumbhakarna, greatly enraged, devoured the Vanaras, running about.
'98': Embracing them with his arms, he devoured them, running about, like the end of time, with his body smeared with fat, marrow, and blood, wearing a garland of intestines hanging from his ears.
'99': With his body smeared with fat, marrow, and blood, wearing a garland of intestines hanging from his ears, he showered spears, with sharp fangs, like the end of time.
'100': At that time, the son of Sumitra, the destroyer of enemy forces, Lakshmana, enraged, engaged in battle, the conqueror of enemy cities.
'101': The mighty Lakshmana pierced Kumbhakarna's body with seven arrows and took up others, releasing them.
'102': The Rakshasa, being tormented by that weapon, felt a special pain, and the mighty son of Sumitra became enraged.
'103': Then, his bright armor, made of gold, was covered with arrows, like a cloud by the wind.
'104': Resembling a mass of blue collyrium, adorned with golden ornaments, he shone like the sun with its rays covered by clouds.
'105': Then, the terrifying Rakshasa, addressing the son of Sumitra, spoke with disdain, his voice like the roar of a cloud.
'106': '"Even the conqueror of death in battle, who is difficult to defeat, has been made known by you, who are fearless in battle, as a hero.'
'107': Even standing before me, armed in this great battle, you are worthy of honor, like death itself, what to say of one who gives battle?
'108': Mounted on Airavata, surrounded by all the gods, even Indra has never stood before me in battle.
'109': Today, O son of Sumitra, I am pleased by your valor and prowess, and I wish to go, having sought your permission, to Raghava.
'110': Pleased by your valor, strength, and enthusiasm in battle, I wish to slay Rama alone, for with him slain, all is slain.
'111': When Rama is slain by me here, those who remain in battle, I shall fight with my own mighty army.
'112': Having spoken thus, the Rakshasa, with words of praise, spoke terrible words in the battle, and Lakshmana, as if laughing, replied.
'113': '"You, who are unbearable by the gods like Indra, having attained prowess, today your valor is seen, O hero.'
'114': This is the son of Dasaratha, Rama, standing like a mountain, unshakable." Hearing this, disregarding Lakshmana, the Rakshasa rushed towards Rama, shaking the earth.
'115': Then, the son of Dasaratha, Rama, employing a terrible weapon, released sharp arrows at the heart of Kumbhakarna.
'116': Pierced by Rama, as he rushed forward, flames mixed with embers issued from his mouth in anger.
'117': Pierced by Rama's weapon, the mighty Rakshasa, roaring terribly, rushed forward, scattering the Vanaras in battle.
'118': The arrows, with peacock feathers, sank into his chest, and his mace fell from his hand to the ground.
'119': All his weapons scattered on the ground, the mighty one, realizing himself to be without weapons,
'120': with fists and hands, caused great destruction. Pierced by arrows, his body covered in blood, he poured forth blood like a mountain with streams.
'121': Overcome with intense anger and fainting from the blood, he ran about, devouring Vanaras, Rakshasas, and bears.
'122': Then, wielding a terrible mountain peak, the mighty one, resembling the end of time, hurled it at Rama.
'123': Before it reached him, Rama, with seven straight arrows, cut the mountain peak, and again, stringing his bow,
'124': the righteous Rama, with arrows adorned with golden designs, cut the great mountain peak.
'125': That mountain peak, resembling the peak of Meru, shining with splendor, fell, crushing two hundred Vanaras.
'126': At that time, the righteous Lakshmana, addressing Rama, engaged in the slaying of Kumbhakarna, considered many strategies.
'127': '"This one does not recognize the Vanaras or the Rakshasas, maddened by the scent of blood, he devours both his own and others.'
'128': Let the foremost Vanaras climb upon him from all sides, and let the chief leaders stand around him.
'129': Today, this wicked Rakshasa, burdened by his own weight, wandering on the earth, will not harm other Vanaras.
'130': Hearing the words of the wise prince, they joyfully climbed upon the mighty Kumbhakarna.
'131': Kumbhakarna, enraged, shook them off with great speed, like a wicked elephant shaking off mahouts.
'132': Seeing them shaken off, Rama, realizing the Rakshasa was enraged, leaped up with great speed and took up his excellent bow.
'133': With eyes red with anger, the resolute Rama, as if burning with his gaze, rushed towards the Rakshasa with great speed, delighting all the leaders of the Vanaras, oppressed by Kumbhakarna's strength.
'134': Taking up his bow, resembling a serpent, with a strong string, adorned with gold, Rama, reassuring the Vanaras, leaped up, his excellent quiver filled with arrows.
'135': Surrounded by those Vanara troops, extremely difficult to conquer, the heroic Rama, accompanied by Lakshmana, set forth with great strength.
'136': He saw the great Kumbhakarna, adorned with a diadem, the subduer of enemies, with bloodshot eyes, covered in blood.
'137': Rushing towards all, like an enraged elephant of the quarters, seeking the Vanaras, surrounded by Rakshasas,
'138': resembling Vindhya and Mandara, adorned with golden armlets, with blood flowing from his mouth, like a rain cloud rising.
'139': Licking his blood-smeared lips with his tongue, crushing the Vanara army, resembling the end of time,
'140': seeing the foremost Rakshasa, blazing like a fire, the best of men, Rama, strung his bow.
'141': Enraged by the sound of his bow, the foremost Rakshasa, unable to bear the sound, rushed towards Rama.
'142': Then, resembling a cloud driven by the wind, with arms like the coils of the king of serpents, Rama spoke to Kumbhakarna in the battle.
'143': '"Come, O lord of the Rakshasas, do not despair, I stand here with my bow drawn. Know me as the destroyer of the Rakshasa race, and in a moment, you will be unconscious."'
'144': Recognizing him as Rama, Kumbhakarna laughed with a terrible sound, rushing forward in great anger, scattering the Vanaras in battle.
'145': Tearing the hearts of all the forest dwellers, laughing terribly, like the thunder of a cloud,
'146': the mighty Kumbhakarna spoke to Rama, "I am not to be known as Viradha, nor Kabandha, nor Khara, nor Vali, nor Maricha, but Kumbhakarna has come."
'147': '"Behold my terrible mace, entirely made of iron, with which I have conquered the gods and Danavas in the past."'
'148': '"Do not disregard me as one without ears and nose, for I feel no pain from the loss of my ears and nose."'
'149': '"Show your valor on my body, O sinless one, and then I shall devour you, having witnessed your prowess."'
'150': Hearing the words of Kumbhakarna, Rama released arrows with sharp points, like thunderbolts, but the enemy of the gods was not shaken or distressed.
'151': The arrows that cut down Sala trees and slew the foremost of Vanaras, Vali, did not cause pain to Kumbhakarna's body, like thunderbolts.
'152': Drinking those arrows like streams of water with his body, the enemy of Mahendra struck at Rama's arrow speed, wielding that terrible mace with great speed.
'153': Then, the Rakshasa, smeared with blood, terrifying to the great armies of the gods, wielding that terrible mace with great speed, scattered the army of the Vanaras.
'154': Taking up the Vayavya weapon, Rama released it at the Rakshasa, severing his arm with the mace, and the severed arm roared terribly.
'155': The arm of Kumbhakarna, resembling a mountain peak, severed by Rama's arrow, fell upon the army of the Vanara king, crushing the Vanara troops.
'156': The Vanaras, broken and slain, took refuge at the edge, distressed, with their bodies crushed, they beheld the terrible encounter between the king of men and the lord of the Rakshasas.
'157': Kumbhakarna, with his arm severed by the weapon, like a mountain with its peak cut off, uprooted a tree with his hand and rushed towards the king of men in the battle.
'158': Rama, with an arrow endowed with the power of Indra, adorned with gold, struck the raised arm with the tree, resembling the coil of a serpent.
'159': The severed arm of Kumbhakarna, resembling a mountain, fell to the ground, crushing trees, mountains, rocks, Vanaras, and Rakshasas.
'160': Seeing him with his arm severed, rushing suddenly, roaring, Rama swiftly took up two crescent-shaped arrows and severed the Rakshasa's legs in the battle.
'161': His legs, severed, fell to the directions, the quarters, the caves of the mountains, the great ocean, Lanka, and the armies of the Vanaras and Rakshasas, resounding as they fell.
'162': With his arms severed, his legs cut off, his mouth gaping like the mouth of a mare, he rushed towards Rama, roaring like Rahu towards the moon in the sky.
'163': Rama filled his mouth with sharp arrows, with golden shafts, and with his mouth full, he could not speak, groaning with difficulty, he fainted.
'164': Then, taking up an arrow resembling the sun's rays, like the staff of Brahma, like the time of death, Rama released it, swift as the wind.
'165': That arrow, with a beautiful golden shaft, blazing like the sun, with the speed of Indra's thunderbolt, Rama released it at the Rakshasa.
'166': The arrow, propelled by Rama's arm, illuminating the directions with its light, resembling the terrible appearance of a smokeless fire, went with the terrible speed of Indra's thunderbolt.
'167': That arrow, resembling the peak of a great mountain, with well-rounded fangs, adorned with beautiful earrings, severed the head of the lord of the Rakshasas, just as Indra once severed the head of Vritra.
'168': The head of Kumbhakarna, adorned with earrings, shone like the moon in the night, in the midst of the sky, when the sun has risen.
'169': Struck by Rama's arrow, the head of the Rakshasa, resembling a mountain, fell, breaking the chariots, houses, and towers, and brought down the high rampart.
'170': That immense body, shining like the Himalayas, fell into the ocean, crushing crocodiles, great fish, and serpents, and entered the earth.
'171': When the enemy of the Brahmanas and the gods, the mighty Kumbhakarna, was slain in battle, the earth shook, and all the mountains trembled, and the gods rejoiced tumultuously.
'172': Then, the divine sages, great sages, serpents, gods, beings, Garuda, and the Guhyakas, along with the Yakshas and Gandharvas, in the sky, rejoiced at Rama's prowess.
'173': Then, the relatives of the king of the Rakshasas, filled with grief at his death, cried out loudly, seeing the best of the Raghus, like elephants seeing a lion.
'174': Having slain the darkness of the celestial world, like the sun freed from the mouth of Rahu, Rama shone in the midst of the Vanara army, having slain Kumbhakarna in battle.
'175': Many Vanaras, with faces like blooming lotuses, rejoiced, honoring Rama, the son of the king, who had slain the terrible enemy, the mighty Kumbhakarna.
'176': Having slain Kumbhakarna, the crusher of the celestial army, never defeated in great battles, the elder brother of Bharata rejoiced in the battle, like the lord of the gods having slain the great Asura Vritra.
'-1': Thus ends the sixty-seventh chapter in the Yuddha Kanda of the glorious Ramayana of Valmiki, the first epic, named "The Slaying of Kumbhakarna."
