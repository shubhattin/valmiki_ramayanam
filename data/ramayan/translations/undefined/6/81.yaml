'0': Thus begins the chapter known as Ekashītitam in the Yuddha Kāṇḍa of the divine Valmiki Rāmāyaṇa, recounting the notable episode concerning Māyāsītā.
'1': Knowing the true state of his own mind, that noble Rāghava—ever the great soul—withdrawn from the tumultuous swirl of fate, proceeded to enter the town with calm resolve.
'2': Recalling the ferocity with which the demons known as the Tarasvins were previously vanquished, the valorous Rāvaṇa, his eyes aglow with the fierce fire of anger, advanced his designs.
'3': Through the western gate he expelled all the demons; known as Indrajit—a warrior endowed with immense valor and likened in might to Paulastya, the scourge upon divine encampments—he wrought his martial prowess.
'4': Thereupon, beholding his noble brothers Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa arrayed for battle, Indrajit promptly engaged in combat, unleashing his mystic and disruptive Māyā with devastating effect.
'5': Mounted in his chariot and bearing the enchantment of Māyā about Sītā, Indrajit, with strength unparalleled, resolved upon her destruction and set his purpose in motion.
'6': With the purpose of beguiling the minds of all, and possessed of a cunning most surreptitious, he fixed his ire on Sītā and advanced resolutely, his gaze fixed upon the vanara host.
'7': Upon sighting his impending approach, all the denizens of the forest, their arms as steadfast as stone and hearts afire with anger, surged forth to meet the threat.
'8': Foremost among the monkeys, Hanumān hastened into their midst; seizing a mighty weapon fashioned like a horn from the unreachable heights of a mountain, he prepared to act decisively.
'9': On the chariot, Indrajit espied Sītā radiating a blissful countenance; the meek lady, distinguished by her singular fillet and known for her austere observances, was clearly marked by fate.
'10': Adorned in a unique raiment and beloved of Rāghava, her entire form was resplendent with glimmering ornaments, signifying her exalted station and grace.
'11': After a long, intent observation, the resident of Mithilā—indeed, the cherished daughter of Janaka—soon made her presence unmistakably known.
'12': Then he addressed her, the sorrow-stricken and joyless ascetic maiden, having beheld her seated upon the chariot and cherished by the lineage of demon royalty.
'13': Contemplating, 'How might we vanquish her?' the mighty monkey, with his foremost vanara companions at his side, advanced boldly against Rāvaṇa.
'14': Observing the formidable might of the vanaras, Rāvaṇa—seized by wrath and overwhelmed by fury—launched a vicious attack, discharging a barrage of thirty projectiles and forcibly drawing Sītā away.
'15': Upon beholding the fair woman, the demon reproached them, vociferating 'Rāma! Rāma!' as he, employing his potent Māyā, bound her securely to his chariot.
'16': Seeing that her head had been forcibly taken, Hanumān was overcome with deep sorrow; his eyes, brimming with grief like torrents of rain, betrayed the pain of the wind-born hero.
'17': Beholding her—the gracefully formed and wholly comely consort of Rāma—he spoke sternly to the obstinate and wayward scion of demon royalty, his words imbued with the heat of anger.
'18': For the destruction of that base and wretched soul, he assailed the very locks of the one called Keshapa; born in the illustrious lineage of Brahmarshis yet having taken refuge in a demonic womb, his fate was sealed.
'19': How prominently your deeds are steeped in sin, for your mind embraces such iniquity! A brutal scourge among men and a transgressor among women—with base character and paltry sinful valor—you exhibit no repugnance for a deed so unworthy of the noble.
'20': From the very destruction of homes and kingdoms by the hand of Rāma and the dear one of Mithilā, what justification can there be for such cruel and pitiless act?
'21': 'Know this well: should you slay Sītā, you shall not long endure; for by the very act deserving of execution, you have already come under my charge.'
'22': And those who commit the heinous act of murdering women and wreak havoc upon the world through their vile conduct shall forsake this mortal life, ultimately reaping the destiny allotted to restless spirits.
'23': Thus spoke Hanumān, arrayed in his celestial arms and reminiscent of Hari himself; incensed beyond measure, he rushed forth against the son of the demon king.
'24': Endowed with unsurpassed valor, the hero intercepted the enemy in the midst of the forest, repelling the demons who were raging with terrible fury.
'25': Then, having unsettled his foe with a barrage of a thousand missiles, the peerless Indrajit—esteemed among the forces akin to Hari—addressed the indomitable Hanumān.
'26': O Sugrīva, and thou, O Rāma—ye who have come here with a divinely ordained purpose—behold her now, for I shall this very day slay the Vaidehī.
'27': 'And after this deed is done, I will not rest: thereafter I shall vanquish Rāma, Lakṣmaṇa, you as one of the vanaras, and even Sugrīva, along with the ignoble Vibhīṣaṇa.'
'28': Do not declare that women are beyond retribution, O Plavanga; for the grievous wrongs inflicted upon my kin demand that such deeds be met with unyielding vengeance.
'29': Having thus spoken, he himself, with his own illustrious sword gleaming in his hand, struck down the sorrowing Sītā—steeped in the enchantments of Māyā.
'30': The austere maiden—her sacred path marked by the severance of her yajñopavīta—descended upon the earth, O beautiful one renowned for her divine allure.
'31': 'Having slain the lady, Indrajit addressed the valiant Hanumān: ''Let me now behold Rāma’s beloved, whose arms are armed; verily, this steadfast Vaidehī renders your endeavors ineffectual.'''
'32': Thereafter, with his mighty sword, Indrajit himself smote her; overjoyed by his deed, he mounted his chariot amidst a resounding, thunderous clamor.
'33': The vanaras attuned their ears to the distant tumult, its reverberations echoing from afar, as they gathered around the unconquerable stronghold that loomed before them.
'34': Thus, having slain Sītā, Rāvaṇa—his heart exultant and his resolve unyielding—assumed a fierce and triumphant form; and upon witnessing this awe-inspiring visage, the vanaras, their faces clouded with sorrow, lamented in unison.
'-1': Thus concludes the chapter known as Ekashītitam in the Yuddha Kāṇḍa of the revered Valmiki Rāmāyaṇa, the chronicle of the tumultuous events concerning Māyāsītā.
