'0': Thus begins the twenty‐second canto, known as the Setubandha, in the Yuddha Kāṇḍa of the Valmiki Ramayana.
'1': 'Then spoke the foremost of the Raghu dynasty, his words grim and resolute: ‘Today, I shall drain you utterly, O vast and formidable ocean, as though plunging you into the nethermost depths.’'
'2': Behold the ocean, its waters scorched and rendered arid by the fiery barrage of arrows; by my hand, even the once-robust life-force is vanquished and a mighty entity is produced.
'3': By the relentless shower of missiles I have unleashed, the ocean itself will be compelled to retreat towards its far bank, as though borne on swift, determined strides.
'4': You who profess no true manliness nor heroic prowess, know that you shall, in your wretched state, vanish into the abode of demons, overcome by dread.
'5': The mighty hero, gathering together the celestial qualities of Brahma and the potency of his arrows, nocked an arrow resembling the great Brahmadanda upon his peerless bow and, with a rapid sweep, loosed it forth.
'6': In that very moment, as Rama, in his exalted posture of the archer, released his arrows in a burst of disarray, even the lofty mountains trembled as if their ancient peaks were agitated by his force.
'7': He encompassed the entire world in darkness, blotting out all directions, and with swift, decisive blows, set the streams and currents of the earth into immediate disarray.
'8': Along with the myriad stars arrayed obliquely and the twin luminaries—the moon and the sun—their resplendent radiance was subdued and enveloped in pervasive darkness.
'9': Then the brilliant sky was lit by a host of luminous lamps, and from the vast expanse of the heavens there resounded majestic, incomparable tones.
'10': With the vigorous thrust of his strength and as the divine winds formed orderly ranks, the trees were rent asunder and swept away in an instant, as if offered in silent benediction.
'11': Likewise, the towering summits and peaks of the mountains were broken asunder, while in the heavens, colossal clouds amassed in a grand assembly, accompanied by a roaring tumult.
'12': Then, as if sparks of lightning and flames of fierce fire erupted in a consuming blaze, all beings were seen to be devoured in a single, fiery feast.
'13': Invisible creatures, overwhelmed by the dread and resounding roar of destruction, and even the tender offspring trembling in terror, were consigned to ruin.
'14': Even as all creation lay paralyzed by fear, not a single trembling motion was seen; amidst this silence, the formidable, awe‐inspiring demon—leader among giants—advances unfalteringly.
'15': Then, with a speed like that of a multitude at once—possessing a velocity as vast as the deep ocean—he swiftly traversed many yojanas, his pace unmatched by even the swiftest currents.
'16': Thus, though the enemy had nearly reached his destined goal, the peerless Rama, destroyer of foes, halted his further advance with unwavering resolve.
'17': Then, rising from the very heart of the ocean, it as if the sea itself ascended like the radiant sun over mighty trees, mountains, and ranges, its brilliance rivaling that of the celestial orb.
'18': The ocean appeared adorned with coiled, shining serpents and glistening ornaments; its surface shone with a smooth, gem-like luster and was bedecked with a wealth of splendid jewels.
'19': Clad in a garland of red and bearing a celestial mantle reminiscent of a lotus leaf, it radiated divine splendor, while its head became a cascade of every flower in full bloom.
'20': Also arrayed in a form reminiscent of the primordial and festooned with austere yet magnificent ornaments, it was adorned with the precious gems of its very essence, the most excellent of embellishments.
'21': Encircled by precious metals and ornamented with diverse, mountain-like structures of gold, with a continuous chain at its core, there flowed a liquid of subtle, pallid brilliance akin to luminous pearls.
'22': Enveloped by an immense and overflowing radiance reminiscent of the famed Kaustubha gem, the surging waves—awakened like a tumult of dark, stormy winds—rolled in a fierce tumult.
'23': Adorned with embellishments evocative of the sacred Ganga and the mighty Sindhu, and resplendent with celestial ornaments, the ocean was veiled in divine glory while a towering, tempestuous demon, bewildered and immense, surged forth.
'24': Bearing the splendid forms of the deities, manifested in a myriad of divine aspects, the ocean advanced with heroic might, as though invoking its ancient, potent energies.
'25': Then, with palms joined in supplication, one spoke thus to Rama, the mighty archer who wields his arrows with divine precision.
'26': O Raghu, know that the earth, air, sky, water, and even the radiance itself reside in your very nature; by their inherent order, they eternally abide upon the path of righteousness.
'27': This very nature is also mine; though I dwell deep within the vast ocean, should any alteration arise in my form, I shall forthwith declare that profound change unto you.
'28': Neither driven by desire nor by greed, nor restraining out of fear, O offspring of the earth, shall I ever, by any artifice, impede the surging and tumultuous waters.
'29': Thus shall you proceed, and I too shall steadfastly endure; no enemy will prevail as long as the host advances. Like a herd of leaping deer, O Rama, I shall ensure your safe passage over the land.
'30': Then Rama addressed him, saying, ‘Listen, O abode of Varuna; tell me, into which region shall be discharged this infallible, mighty arrow?’
'31': Upon hearing Rama’s words and beholding that formidable arrow, the vast and resplendent ocean—the mighty deep itself—spoke in reply to the illustrious Rama.
'32': In response, I have but one, the most virtuous among my kin, celebrated throughout the worlds as Drumakulya, renowned just as you are.
'33': There, numerous fearsome demons, notorious for their atrocious deeds and foremost among the wicked, eagerly drank of my waters.
'34': May that infallible arrow, O Rama, fulfill its design there; for by its touch no sin may endure, and every evil deed be utterly repelled.
'35': Upon hearing those words from the great soul of the ocean, he released that radiant arrow, inspired by the profound vision of the sea itself.
'36': Thus was on earth established the celebrated bridge—when the arrow struck, falling like a bolt resplendent with the brilliance of thunder.
'37': Then a tumult arose that rent the earth in agony; from its gaping wounds, a fluid like precious nectar emerged from the depths.
'38': Henceforth, that chasm became renowned as the well of wounds; ever rising, its effusion was seen as the very outpouring of the ocean.
'39': And with a terrible sound of rupture—fierce and dreadful—the impact of the arrow drew in the waters, absorbing them deep within the chasms.
'40': Thus, widely renowned in the three worlds and even among the islands, the celebrated bridge was made to dry up, by the will of Rama, the illustrious son of Dasharatha.
'41': To him, the wise and valorous leader among the vanaras—peerless in might—a most excellent boon was bestowed.
'42': Furthermore, the cattle, though few and infirm, together with an abundance of fruits, roots, medicinal herbs, generous milk, and fragrant blossoms, were conferred as offerings.
'43': In this manner, united with these diverse gifts, the vanara king, in gratitude for Rama’s boon, assumed the most auspicious and holy path.
'44': Then, as the depths were scorched, the sovereign of the sea—lord of all streams—spoke these words unto Rama, the all‐learning master of scriptures.
'45': Behold, this gentle soul named Nala, the son of the illustrious Vishvakarma, bestowed by his father as a precious boon, who shines with beauty and endearment.
'46': This vanara, with grand enthusiasm, is to construct the bridge on my behalf; and I shall uphold it steadfastly, just as his illustrious father once did.
'47': Thus having spoken, with the ocean subdued beneath him, Nala arose and addressed Rama, the foremost among the vanaras, with these solemn words.
'48': ‘I shall build the bridge across the vast realm of Makara-laya, having invoked the strength granted to me by my father,’ declared the mighty ocean in affirmation.
'49': It is my belief that the staff is the noblest of arms for a man; yet I extend forgiveness and generous gifts even to those who are ungrateful.
'50': Verily, this vast ocean, witnessing the bridge’s construction as a mighty feat, granted to Rama, the son of Dasharatha, a fearsome, formidable weapon akin to a mace.
'51': My mother, the most illustrious of all, was granted by Vishvakarma; and likewise, O Devi, a son resembling me shall be born unto you.
'52': I indeed am that son, fashioned in likeness by Vishvakarma; having thus attested, the great ocean declared the profound truth, and I shall not refrain from extolling my own virtues.
'53': I too possess the might to construct the bridge in Varuna’s dominion; therefore, let the eminent vanaras now set about binding the bridge without delay.
'54': Then, at Rama’s command, the vanaras—beloved and numerous—were sent forth from every quarter; let them, with joyous hearts numbering in the hundred thousands, swiftly raise the vast mass of timber.
'55': They, arranged like a myriad of trees and as numerous as celestial hosts—with branches resembling a herd of deer—uprooted the vegetation and laid it across the ocean expanse.
'56': There also were vanaras wielding boughs of palmyra and stout trunks, arrayed like swift steeds and noble clans, even accompanied by clusters of palm fronds and assorted supports.
'57': Using bilva trees with their seven-leaved fronds, Karunika blossomed flowers, along with Palas and Ashoka trees, they entirely spanned the breadth of the ocean with their living materials.
'58': They uprooted whole plants along with their remnants—the finest of trees—assembling them as if in streams unfurling like the banner of Indra.
'59': They collected palmyra trees, clusters of date-palm, and numerous coconut trees; and then arranged, in order, the kareera, bakula, and nimba trees with due care.
'60': They conveyed immense stones, as heavy as those borne by elephants, and portions of mountains, cutting and arranging them with ingenious contrivances.
'61': As the immovable masses were hurled together, the waters were suddenly uplifted; and then, like an ascending serpent, the celestial sphere itself seemed to draw the water back.
'62': They stirred the ocean into a trembling fury, as if it were collapsing in all directions, and with various cords they secured it, spanning a distance of a hundred yojanas.
'63': At the very center of that mighty structure—near the famed island of the river’s lord—the bridge was fashioned by the vanaras with tireless, heroic labor.
'64': Other maces and implements were gathered and arranged in proper order, exactly as ordained by Rama’s command, conveyed to them by his devoted attendants.
'65': Utilizing natural supports of earth, mountains, grasses, and timber, and with flowering treetops as additional foundations, the vanaras set about erecting the bridge.
'66': The stones, renowned mountain masses, and lofty peaks of hills were seen encircling the bridge, as though gathered in assembly like a horde of demons.
'67': In that place, as the rocks and mountains were hurled and cast, a tremendous, resounding clamor arose within that mighty ocean.
'68': Firstly, by the strength of elephants in swift procession, fourteen yojanas were accomplished with exultation and rapid pace among the swimmers.
'69': Secondly, by the fleet of swimmers moving with great swiftness, twenty yojanas were completed by those of colossal might and power.
'70': Thirdly, in the light of the day and amidst the ocean’s expanse, a single mighty being swiftly achieved the construction of twenty yojanas.
'71': Fourthly, during the latter part of the day, even as if by chariots of the gods, twenty yojanas were rapidly erected with tremendous speed.
'72': Fifthly, in the afternoon as well, by the resourceful swimmers employing expedient methods, twenty-three yojanas were constructed exactly in the appointed time.
'73': That foremost vanara, illustrious and as mighty as one born of Vishvakarma, thus constructed the bridge across the ocean in the same manner as his father once did.
'74': Thus, by the skill of Nala, the bridge was fashioned in the vast ocean of Makara-laya; it is virtuous and stately—like a resplendent pathway spanning the heavens.
'75': Thereafter, the gods, gandharvas, siddhas, and eminent sages ascended to the celestial realms to behold that marvelous spectacle with rapt attention.
'76': Spanning over ten yojanas in breadth and extending to a hundred yojanas in length, the divine assembly beheld the arduous Nala-bridge with wonder and awe.
'77': They leapt, they swam, and they thundered forth—the illustrious swimmers; truly, the undertaking was beyond imagining, insurmountable, and a stupendous, earth‐shaking marvel.
'78': All creatures witnessed the wondrous construction of the bridge across the ocean; innumerable crores of valorous vanaras participated in this mighty feat.
'79': Having secured the bridge upon the ocean, they advanced to the far shore of the vast deep; their host was immense, virtuous, and supremely united.
'80': The magnificent bridge, grand though unadorned like a natural boundary of the ocean, stood firm; and upon the far bank, the mace-bearing one—Vibheeshana—made his appearance.
'81': With his counselors arrayed to counter the foes on that distant shore, Sugriva then addressed Rama, proclaiming, ‘O Rama, you are the very embodiment of true valor and righteousness.’
'82': Hanuman, you ascend; and with you go Angada and Lakshmana—truly, this immense ocean of Makara is the abode of the brave and the mighty.
'83': O you youthful vanaras, bear the burden of the task; at the forefront of the host marched the illustrious Rama accompanied by Lakshmana.
'84': The virtuous archer, allied with Sugriva, advanced resolutely while others moved along the center, and still others swam rapidly along the flanks.
'85': Some plunged into the waters, others proceeded along different paths; indeed, a few, like the winged ones of ancient lore, even took to the air in swift flight.
'86': A mighty roar resounded across the ocean as its waves echoed tumultuously; amid this, an overwhelming force surged forth, bearing the celestial might of Hari.
'87': For the vanaras the bridge—the Nala-Setu—was their passage; upon the far shore the sovereigns took their seats, reaping manifold rewards and fruits.
'88': Observing that wondrous and formidable act of Rama, the gods, accompanied by sagacious and accomplished sages, swiftly gathered him and saluted him with venerable rites and a shower of auspicious waters.
'89': ‘Hail, defeat your enemies, O noble scion of men; preserve the earth and the boundless ocean for all eternity!’ Thus was Rama extolled by men and celebrated with diverse, auspicious praises.
'-1': Thus ends the twenty‐second canto—the Setubandha—in the Yuddha Kāṇḍa of the Adikāvya, the Valmiki Ramayana.
