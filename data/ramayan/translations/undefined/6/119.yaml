'4': Then, wiping her tear-stained face, she slowly spoke to her husband with a voice choked with emotion.
'5': '"Why do you, O hero, address me with such harsh and ear-piercing words, as if I were a common woman?"'
'6': '"O mighty-armed one, I am not as you perceive me to be. Trust in my own character, I swear to you by it."'
'7': '"You suspect my birth due to the conduct of other women. Abandon this doubt if I have been tested by you."'
'8': '"O lord, when I was helpless and touched by another, it was not by my will. The divine is to be blamed for that."'

'12': '"In the presence of this Vanara, immediately after his words, if you had abandoned me, O hero, I would have given up my life."'
'13': '"Your effort would not have been in vain, and my life, placed in doubt, would have ended. The suffering of your friends would not have been fruitless."'
'14': '"O tiger among men, by following anger alone, you have treated me lightly, like a common man would treat a woman."'
'15': '"O knower of conduct, you have not considered my origin from Janaka, nor my emergence from the earth, nor my conduct, which is well known to you."'
'16': '"My hand, which was clasped in childhood, has not been accepted as a proof. My devotion and character have all been disregarded by you."'
'17': Thus speaking, weeping, and with a voice choked with tears, Sita addressed Lakshmana, who was absorbed in thought and dejected.
'18': '"O Saumitri, prepare a pyre for me, the remedy for this calamity. Struck by false accusations, I am unable to live."'
'19': '"Abandoned by my husband, who is displeased with my virtues, in the presence of people, I shall enter the fire, which is my refuge."'
'20': Thus addressed by Vaidehi, Lakshmana, the slayer of enemy heroes, overcome by anger, looked at Raghava.
'21': Understanding the intention of Rama, indicated by his demeanor, the valiant Saumitri prepared the pyre according to Rama's command.
'22': At that time, no friend could persuade, speak to, or even look at Rama, who was like the god of death at the end of time.
'23': Then, having circumambulated Rama, who stood with his head bent down, Vaidehi approached the blazing fire.
'24': Bowing to the deities and the Brahmanas, Maithili, with folded hands, spoke these words near the fire.
'25': '"As my heart never strays from Raghava, may the fire, the witness of the world, protect me from all sides."'
'26': '"As Raghava considers me impure, though I am of pure conduct, may the fire, the witness of the world, protect me from all sides."'
'27': '"As I have not transgressed against Raghava, the knower of all dharma, in action, thought, or word, may the fire protect me."'
'28': '"May the sun, the wind, the directions, the moon, the day, the twilight, the night, the earth, and all others who know me, protect me, who is endowed with character."'
'29': Having spoken thus, Vaidehi circumambulated the fire and entered the blazing flames with a fearless heart.

'31': Resembling newly molten gold and adorned with golden ornaments, she fell into the blazing fire in the presence of all the worlds.
'32': All forms of Sita, with wide eyes and resembling a golden altar, were seen entering the fire.
'33': The sages, gods, and Gandharvas saw the illustrious Sita entering the fire, like a full offering in a sacrifice.
'34': All the women cried out upon seeing her, adorned with mantras, falling into the fire, like a stream of ghee in a sacrifice.
