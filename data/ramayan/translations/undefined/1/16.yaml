'0': And now, the 16th chapter in the Childhood Section of Valmiki Ramayanam, named 'Emergence of Elixir'.
'1': Then, Narayana, Vishnu, assigned by the foremost of the gods, spoke gently to them despite knowing all.
'2': “O gods, what is the strategy for killing that king of the Rakshasas? By which method should I proceed to eliminate the tormentor of the sages?”
'3': Thus addressed, all the gods replied to the imperishable Vishnu, “Assuming a human form, slay Ravana in battle.”
'4': “That enemy of the gods performed severe penance for a long time, by which Brahma, the creator of the worlds and the first being, was pleased.”
'5': “The Lord, being pleased, granted him a boon, assuring him freedom from fear from all beings, except from humans.”
'6': “Out of pride in the boon, he disregarded humans, and hence, he oppresses the three worlds and abducts women.”
'7': “Therefore, his death can only come from humans, O tormentor of foes.”
'8': Hearing these words from the gods, the self-possessed Vishnu decided then to choose King Dasharatha as his father.
'9': At that time, the illustrious king Dasharatha, who was childless and desirous of sons, performed a great sacrifice for progeny.
'10': Having made his decision, Vishnu, after taking leave from Brahma, disappeared, being honoured by the gods and great sages.
'11': तभी राजा के यज्ञ की अग्नि से अप्रतिम तेज और अपार पराक्रम से युक्त एक पुरुष प्रकट हुआ।
'12': Dark in complexion, wearing red garments, with a red face, and a voice like a drum, he had a shining golden complexion, with hair and a beard of smooth texture.
'13': He was endowed with auspicious marks and adorned with divine ornaments, standing tall like a mountain peak with the prowess of a proud tiger.
'14': Resembling the sun in radiance, like the blazing flames of fire, he held a vessel made of gold, silver-plated, and filled with divine payasam (sweet rice pudding).
'15': Carrying that divine vessel, filled with nectar-like payasam, with his broad arms, he resembled an embodiment of magic, standing before the king.
'16': 'He then addressed King Dasharatha with these words: “Know me to be the messenger of Prajapati, having come here, O king.”'
'17': At that, the king, with folded hands, humbly responded, “O revered one, welcome to you. What can I do for you?”
'18': The messenger of Prajapati spoke again, “O king, through your worship of the gods, this has come to you today.”
'19': “This divine payasam, created by the gods, is for the purpose of creating progeny. O tiger among men, receive this. It will bring you great fortune and health.”
'20': “Give this to your wives who are fit to bear children. From them, you will receive sons, for whom you performed the sacrifice, O king.”
'21': The king, delighted, accepted the golden vessel, filled with the divine food of the gods, with great respect, bowing his head.
'22': Having saluted the wonderful being, who was delightful to behold, the king, filled with immense joy, circumambulated him with great reverence.
'23': King Dasharatha, having received the divine payasam made by the gods, was extremely pleased, like a poor man acquiring wealth.
'24': That magnificent and radiant being, after completing his task, vanished from there, radiating brilliance as he disappeared.
'25': The inner chambers of the palace lit up with rays of joy, just like the autumn sky is illuminated by the beams of the pleasing moon.
'26': The king entered the inner chambers and said to Kausalya, “Accept this payasam, meant for begetting children, for yourself.”
'27': The king gave half of the payasam to Kausalya, and from that half he gave another half to Sumitra.
'28': He gave the remaining portion to Kaikeyi for the purpose of obtaining sons, and after that, he gave the last remaining portion to Sumitra again.
'29': Thinking carefully, the wise king divided the payasam separately among his wives.
'30': Having received the divine payasam from the king, the foremost queens felt greatly honoured, their hearts filled with joy.
'31': Then those noble wives of the king, having consumed the excellent payasam, which was as bright as fire, soon conceived children, radiating like the sun and Agni.
'32': Seeing his wives pregnant and with his mind restored to peace, the king was overjoyed, like Indra in heaven, praised by the gods, Siddhas, and great sages.
'-1': Thus is the 16th chapter in the Childhood Section of the Valmiki Ramayanam, named 'Emergence of Elixir'.
