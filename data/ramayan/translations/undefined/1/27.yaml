'20': '"O mighty-armed Rama, receive these divine, powerful, and immensely glorious weapons, capable of taking on any form. Receive them quickly, O prince."'
'21': Standing there facing east, the great sage, filled with delight, imparted the collection of supreme mantras to Rama.
'22': Those weapons, which are difficult even for the gods to acquire, were then given by the sage to Raghava.
'23': As the Sage Vishwamitra, the wise one, chanted the mantras, all the powerful divine weapons appeared before Rama.
'24': 'All of them, filled with joy, addressed Rama with joined palms, saying:'
'25': '"We are all your servants, O Raghava, and whatever you wish, we shall accomplish for you, O auspicious one."'
'26': Then Rama, pleased with them and their words, graciously accepted them and touched them with his hand.
'27': He said, "Be present with me whenever I desire." Thus, he commanded the weapons.
'28': With a delighted heart, Rama then bowed to the great sage Vishwamitra and, filled with great energy, began their journey.
