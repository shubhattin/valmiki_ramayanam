'0': और अब, वाल्मीकि-रामायण के बालकांड में  'नारदजी का कथन' नामक पहला सर्ग ।
'1': Maharishi Valmiki, the great ascetic, asked Narada, who is engaged in the Vedas, penance, and studies, who is the best of the eloquent orators, thus...
'2': '"ఈ ప్రస్తుత ప్రపంచంలో ఎవడు సద్గుణవంతుడు, ఎవడు ధైర్యవంతుడు? ధర్మపరిజ్ఞానం ఉండి, కృతజ్ఞతతో నిండినవాడు ఎవడు? ఎవడు నిజం మాట్లాడతాడు, ఎవడు తన ప్రమాణాలలో దృఢంగా ఉంటాడు?'
'3': अच्छे शिष्टाचार किसके पास है? किसका मन सभी प्राणियों का कल्याण चाहता है? कौन शिक्षित, सक्षम है और कौन देखने में प्रिय है?
'4': Who is self-controlled, who has conquered anger, who is radiant, and who is free from envy? Whom do the gods themselves fear in battle when his wrath is kindled?”
'5': “I wish to hear of such a man, for my curiosity is intense. O great sage, you are capable of knowing such a person.”
'6': Upon hearing these words of Valmiki, Narada, who knew the three worlds, joyfully spoke these words, starting with “Listen.”
'7': “O Sage, the qualities you have mentioned are indeed many and rare. After considering them, I will tell you of a man who possesses them. Hear me now!”
'8': “There is a man known by the name of Rama, born in the Ikshvaku dynasty. He is self-restrained, immensely powerful, radiant, resolute, and self-controlled.
'9': He is wise, virtuous, eloquent, illustrious, and a destroyer of foes. His shoulders are broad, his arms long, his neck conch-shaped, and his jaws wide set.
'10': He has a large chest, is an expert archer, has deep collar bones, and is the subduer of enemies. His arms rest on his knees when seated, his head is well-formed, his forehead is broad, and he is of great prowess.”
'11': He is symmetrical in form, with well-proportioned limbs, a smooth complexion, and a gentle glow. His chest is broad, his eyes are large, and he is endowed with Lakshmi (prosperity) and auspicious marks.
'12': He knows dharma, is truthful in his promises, and is devoted to the welfare of his people. He is renowned, full of knowledge, pure, self-controlled, and focused in meditation.
'13': He is like Prajapati (the creator) in majesty, and like Dhata (the sustainer) in power, destroying enemies. He protects all living beings and safeguards the principles of dharma.
'14': He is the protector of his own dharma and the protector of his own people. He is an expert in the Vedas and their branches and highly skilled in the art of archery.
'15': He knows the essence of all scriptures, is mindful, and has great intellect. He is beloved by all people, virtuous, compassionate, and highly discerning.
'16': He is constantly sought after by the virtuous, just as rivers seek the ocean. He treats everyone equally, is noble, and is always pleasing to the eyes.
'17': Endowed with all virtues, he is the delight of Kausalya. In depth, he is like the ocean, and in patience, like the Himalayas.
'18': In valour, he is like Vishnu and as charming as the moon. In anger, he is like the fire of destruction, and in forgiveness, he is like the earth.
'19': In generosity, he is like Kubera, and in truth, he is like Dharma personified. To such Rama, who is full of all these virtues and who is clearly established in truth...
'20': ఉత్తమమైన లక్షణాలను కలిగి ఉన్న దశరథ రాజు పెద్ద కుమారుడిని, ప్రజలకు ప్రియమైనవాడిని, ఎల్లప్పుడూ పౌరుల సంక్షేమంలో నిమగ్నమైన వాడిని, తన ప్రజల హితం కోరినవాడై...
'21': With affection, King Dasharatha desired to appoint Rama as the heir apparent (Yuvraja). However, upon seeing the preparations for the coronation, Queen Kaikeyi...
'22': 'The queen, who had been granted two boons earlier, demanded those boons: the exile of Rama and the coronation of Bharata.'
'23': Bound by his promise and the bonds of dharma, King Dasharatha, though grieved, exiled his beloved son Rama.
'24': वीर राम, अपनी प्रतिज्ञा का पालन करते हुए, अपने पिता के शब्दों का पालन करने और कैकेयी की इच्छाओं को पूरा करने के लिए वन में चले गए।
'25': Out of love and respect, his devoted younger brother Lakshmana, who enhances the joy of Sumitra, full of humility,
'26': followed Rama displaying a strong sense of kinship. Sita, Rama's beloved wife, who was always dear to him and like his life itself.
'27': జనక రాజు కుటుంబంలో జన్మించి, దైవిక శక్తితో సృష్టించబడినట్టిదీ, అన్ని ధర్మాలలో పరిపూర్ణురాలు, మరియు మహిళలందరిలో ఉత్తమమైనదీ అయినదీ,
'28': "सीता भी राम के पीछे चलीं जैसे चन्द्रमा के पीछे रोहिणी चलती है। पिता दशरथ ने और पुरवासी मनुष्यों ने दूर तक उनका अनुसरण किया।\t\t\t\t"
'29': శృంగవేరపురంలో, గంగా ఒడ్డున, రాముడు తన సారథిని విడిచిపెట్టి, తనకు ప్రియమైన, సద్గుణవంతుడైన, నిషాదుల అధిపతి అయిన గుహుడిని కలిసి,
'30': రాముడు, లక్ష్మణుడు , సీత, గుహుడు కలిసి అనేక నదులను దాటి అడవిలోకి మరింత లోతుగా వెళ్ళారు.
'31': Following the instructions of Sage Bharadwaja, Rama, Lakshmana, and Sita arrived at Chitrakoota. They made a beautiful dwelling there, and after enjoying living in the forest together...
'32': Resembling gods and Gandharvas in their appearance, the three of them lived happily in Chitrakoota. Meanwhile, back in Ayodhya, King Dasharatha, tormented by grief for his son.
'33': King Dasharatha’s departed to the heavens, mourning the loss of his son. Then, Bharata, though urged by Vasishta and other great sages...
'34': To take up rulership, that highly valorous one did not desire the kingdom. He too went to the forest to fall at Rama's feet.
'35': Upon reaching the great and truthful Rama, Bharata, approaching with honour and respect, begged for his brother to return.
'36': Bharata said, "You alone are the rightful king, O Noble One!" However, the exceedingly noble and gracious Rama, who was of great fame,
'37': did not desire the kingdom due to his father’s command. Rama offered Bharata his sandals as a symbol of rulership, in his stead and repeatedly
'38': declined Bharata's persistent attempts. Without getting what he desired, Bharata, touching Rama’s feet in reverence,
'39': Bharata returned to Nandigrama and governed the kingdom, always awaiting Rama’s return. As Bharata returned, Rama, the noble and self-restrained one,
'40': seeing the gathering of citizens at Chitrakoota, decided to enter the Dandaka forest with single-minded focus.
'41': Entering the great forest, Rama, the lotus-eyed one, killed the demon Viradha and then met the sage Sharabhanga.
'42': He also met the sages Sutikshna, Agastya, and Agastya’s brother. As per Agastya’s instruction, Rama joyfully received the divine bow of Indra.
'43': धनुष के साथ उन्हें एक खड्ग और दो तरकश भी मिले जिनके बाण कभी समाप्त नहीं होते थे। चूँकि वे वन में वनवासियों के साथ रह रहे थे,
'44': असुर तथा राक्षसों के वध के लिये निवेदन करने वहां के सभी ऋषि उन्के पास आये। राम ने उन से उस वन के राक्षसों के बारे में सुना ।
'45': Rama promised the rishis, who lived in Dandaka forest and were as radiant as fire, that he would destroy the rakshasas in battle.
'46': While residing in the forest, a rakshasi named Shurpanakha, living in Janasthana, who could change her form at will, approached Rama and was disfigured by him.
'47': Incited by Shurpanakha’s words, the rakshasas Khara, Trishiras, and Dushana, along with their forces, prepared for battle against Rama.
'48': In that battle, Rama destroyed Khara, Trishiras, Dushana, and their entire army, who were residing in Janasthana.
'49': A total of 14,000 rakshasas were killed. Hearing the slaughter of his kinsmen, Ravana was consumed by rage.
'50': Seeking assistance, Ravana approached the rakshasa Maricha. Maricha tried to dissuade him many times, saying...
'51': '"Do not oppose a powerful one, O Ravana. It is not wise for you." However, disregarding this advice, Ravana, driven by fate, proceeded.'
'52': Accompanied by Maricha, Ravana reached Rama's hermitage. Using Maricha’s illusion, he lured the two princes away from the hermitage.
'53': He then abducted Rama’s wife, Sita, after killing the vulture Jatayu. Looking at the dead vulture and upon hearing of Sita's abduction,
'54': Rama, overwhelmed by sorrow, lamented with his senses in disarray. Then in that sorrow, after cremating Jatayu's body,
'55': While searching the forest for Sita, he encountered a terrifying rakshasa named Kabandha, deformed in appearance.
'56': Rama, the mighty-armed one, killed the rakshasa and sent him to the heavens. Before departing, Kabandha, taking about the pious and righteous Shabari to Rama, said...
'57': '"Oh Raghava! Visit Shabari, an ascetic who is an expert in Dharma! The highly resplendent Rama, the destroyer of enemies, approached Shabari.'
'58': After being worshipped well by Shabari, Rama, the son of Dasharatha, met the Vanara, Hanuman, on the banks of the Pampa River.
'59': At Hanuman's suggestion, Rama met Sugriva and narrated all that had occurred so far.
'60': Upon hearing everything from the beginning, especially of Sita's abduction from Rama, the Vanara, Sugriva...
'61': forged a pact of friendship with Rama, with Agni as the witness. Then the King of Vanaras spoke about his enemies.
'62': "Sugriva\_then\_told\_Rama\_about\_his\_adversaries,\_with\_affection\_and\_profound\_grief.\_Rama\_promised\_to\_kill\_Vali\_in\_return."
'63': Sugriva also explained Vali's immense strength. However, Sugriva doubted Rama's strength and was constantly uncertain about Rama's ability.
'64': To prove his strength, Sugriva showed Rama the enormous body of Dundubhi, which resembled a massive mountain.
'65': The mighty-armed Rama, with a smile, used his big toe to hurl the entire body of Dundubhi ten yojanas.
'66': Next, Rama shot a single arrow that pierced through seven sala trees, the mountain, and even into the netherworld, thus reassuring Sugriva.
'67': With his heart now filled with joy and trust in Rama, the great Vanara, Sugriva, went with Rama to the cave of Kishkindha.
'68': There, Sugriva, the golden-hued king of the Vanaras, let out a tremendous roar. Hearing this thunderous sound, Vali, the lord of the Vanaras, came out.
'69': After consulting Tara, Vali engaged in battle with Sugriva. During the fight, Rama killed Vali with a single arrow.
'70': As per Sugriva’s request, slaying Vali in battle, Rama restored the kingdom back to Sugriva.
'71': Sugriva, the best of the Vanaras, gathered all the Vanaras and sent them in different directions to search for Janaka’s daughter, Sita.
'72': Then, based on the words of the vulture Sampati, the powerful Hanuman leaped across the vast ocean, which was a hundred yojanas wide.
'73': Reaching Lanka, the city ruled by Ravana, Hanuman saw Sita, who was deep in thought, in the Ashoka grove.
'74': After giving her Rama’s token of recognition and conveying all the news, he consoled the grieving Vaidehi and then proceeded to destroy the gateway.
'75': He killed the five foremost leaders of the army, the seven sons of ministers, and crushed the valiant Aksha. Eventually, he allowed himself to be captured.
'76': Realising that he was invulnerable to Brahmastra due to the boon granted by Brahma, the brave Hanuman calmly tolerated the rakshasas who bound him.
'77': After setting Lanka ablaze, except for the place where Maithili was, the great Vanara returned to deliver good news to Rama.
'78': Approaching the noble Rama and circumambulating him, the boundless Hanuman reported, "Seen, she has been!"
'79': Then, along with Sugriva, Rama reached the shores of the vast ocean and, with arrows as radiant as the sun, began to stir the waters.
'80': The ocean, the lord of rivers, appeared before Rama, and following the ocean’s advice, Rama constructed a bridge across the waters through Nala.
'81': Reaching Lanka by that bridge, killing Ravana in battle, regaining Sita, Rama was overtaken by intense embarrassment.
'82': In the presence of the public, Rama spoke harsh words to Sita. Unable to bear this accusation, the virtuous Sita entered the blazing fire.
'83': Then, at Agni's words, as he realised the sinless Sita, through that great act, the three worlds, and all creatures...
'84': The gods, sages, and all living beings were immensely pleased. Rama was then overjoyed and radiant and was worshipped by all Devatas.
'85': Coronating Vibhishana as the king of the rakshasas in Lanka, feeling fulfilled and free of all grief, Rama rejoiced.
'86': After receiving a boon from the gods and reviving the Vanaras who had fallen in battle, Rama, accompanied by his friends, set out for Ayodhya in the Pushpaka Vimana.
'87': Reaching the ashram of Bharadwaja, the truthful and valorous Rama sent Hanuman ahead to deliver a message to Bharata.
'88': Conversing again with Sugriva, Rama then mounted the Pushpaka Vimana and journeyed to Nandigrama.
'89': At Nandigrama, the sinless Rama, along with his brothers, removed his matted locks and, after reuniting with Sita, regained his kingdom.
'90': The people were filled with joy, happiness, and contentment. They were prosperous, righteous, healthy, and free from disease, fear, and famine.
'91': In Rama's kingdom, no one witnesses the death of their children at any time, women will always be faithful to their husbands, never becoming widows.
'92': అగ్ని భయం ఉండదు, ఏ జీవీ నీట మునిగిపోదు. గాలి నుండి భయం, జ్వరాల వల్ల కలిగే బాధ ఉండవు.
'93': There is no fear of hunger, nor any fear of thieves. Cities and kingdoms will be filled with wealth and grains.
'94': Everyone will always be happy, just as in Krita Yuga. Rama is going to perform a hundred Ashvamedha Yajnas, offering abundant gold.
'95': विद्वानों को उचित अनुष्ठानों, विधिपूर्वक लाखों गायें दान कर, और ब्राह्मणों को अपरिमित धन दान करके,
'96': that Raghava shall establish a hundredfold royal families. The four varnas too in this world shall be employed in their respective duties.
'97': After ruling the kingdom for ten thousand years and another hundred years, Rama shall ascend to Brahmaloka.
'98': The one who reads this sacred, sin-destroying story, which is praised by the Vedas, shall be freed from all sins.
'99': Reading this Ramayana, which bestows long life, will attain happiness in heaven after death, alongside his children, grandchildren, and companions.
'100': By reciting this, a Brahmin will gain eloquence, a Kshatriya will attain rulership of the earth, a Vaishya will gain abundant wealth, and even a Shudra will attain gracefulness.
'-1': इस प्रकार महर्षि वाल्मीकि द्वारा रचित आदिकाव्य श्रीमद्रामायण के बालकाण्ड में 'नारदजी का कथन' नामक पहला सर्ग पूरा हुआ ।
