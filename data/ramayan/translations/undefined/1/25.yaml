'0': And now, the 25th chapter in the Childhood Section of Valmiki Ramayanam, named 'Tataka's Tale'.
'1': 'Hearing the excellent words of that incomprehensible sage, the tiger among men (Rama) replied in auspicious words:'
'2': '"O eminent sage, it is heard that the Yakshini is weak in strength. How, then, does this weak one bear the strength of a thousand elephants?"'
'3': 'Hearing the words of the immensely powerful Raghava, Vishwamitra, delighting both Rama and Lakshmana with his gentle words, spoke:'
'4': '"Listen, O hero, to how she possesses such immense strength. It is due to a boon granted to her that this weak one has the power."'
'5': '"Long ago, there was a great Yaksha named Suketu, who was valorous and virtuous. He had no children and performed great penance."'
'6': '"Pleased with his penance, Brahma, the great progenitor, granted him a daughter, O Rama, who was named Tataka."'
'7': '"Brahma also gave her the strength of a thousand elephants, but he did not grant a son to the great Yaksha."'
'8': '"When she grew up, radiant with beauty and youth, her illustrious father gave her in marriage to Sunda, the son of Jambha."'
'9': '"After some time, the Yakshini gave birth to a son named Maricha, who became invincible and, due to a curse, was turned into a Rakshasa."'
'10': '"When Sunda was killed, O Rama, the great sage Agastya, became the target of Tataka''s desire for vengeance, along with her son."'
'11': '"क्रोधित होकर, वह उसे खा जाने के इरादे से दहाड़ते हुए उसकी ओर आई। उसे पास आते देख, दिव्य ऋषि अगस्त्य ने,'
'12': 'अपने अत्यंत क्रोध में श्राप दिया: ''राक्षस बन जाओ!'' और इस प्रकार मारीच बदल गया। उन्होंने ताताका को भी श्राप दिया।"'
'13': saying, 'You, great Yakshini, with a misshapen face, abandon this form at once and assume a dreadful appearance.'
'14': तब से, श्राप से उत्पन्न क्रोध से प्रेरित होकर, ताताका, क्रोध से भरकर, अगस्त्य द्वारा पवित्र किए गए इस पवित्र क्षेत्र को तबाह कर रहा है।
'15': '"O Raghava, kill this wicked and extremely dreadful Yakshini for the protection of cows and Brahmanas, and put an end to her wicked deeds."'
'16': '"हे रघुवासी, आपके अलावा तीनों लोकों में कोई भी उसे मारने में सक्षम नहीं है, क्योंकि वह शाप से पीड़ित है।"'
'17': '"Do not feel any pity for killing a woman, O best among men. For the welfare of the four social orders, it is a duty for the son of a king."'
'18': '"चाहे वह क्रूर प्रतीत हो या न हो, चाहे वह पापपूर्ण हो या दोषपूर्ण हो, एक राजा को हमेशा किसी भी तरह से अपनी प्रजा की रक्षा करनी चाहिए।"'
'19': '"This is the eternal duty of those appointed to govern a kingdom. Slay this unrighteous one, O Kakutstha, for there is no righteousness in her."'
'20': '"It is said that in ancient times, Indra killed Manthara, the daughter of Virochana, who intended to destroy the earth."'
'21': '"In earlier times, too, Vishnu killed Kavyamata, the chaste wife of Bhrigu, when she desired a world without Indra.'
'22': '"Many such women, involved in unrighteousness, have been slain by noble princes and great men. Therefore, O king, abandon pity and slay her at my command."'
'-1': Thus is the 25th chapter in the Childhood Section of the Valmiki Ramayanam, named 'Tataka's Tale'.
