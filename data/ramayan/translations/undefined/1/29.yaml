'0': And now, the 29th chapter in the Childhood Section of Valmiki Ramayanam, named 'Shiddhashrama'.
'1': Upon being asked by Rama, the one of immeasurable valour, Vishwamitra, full of great energy, began to explain,
'2': '"O mighty-armed Rama, here, Lord Vishnu, worshipped by the gods, stayed for many years and also for hundreds of yugas."'
'3': '"तपस्या करने के उद्देश्य से, महान तपस्वी यहाँ रहे। यह महात्मा वामन का पूर्व आश्रम है।'
'4': '"It is known as Siddhashrama, for great austerities were performed here, and success was attained. During that time, the renowned King Bali, son of Virochana,'
'5': '"defeated the hosts of gods, including Indra and the Maruts, and established his reign, becoming famous throughout the three worlds."'
'6': '"The mighty Bali, lord of the Asuras, began performing a great sacrifice. The gods, led by Agni, gathered and approached Vishnu here in this hermitage."'
'7': '"Bali, the son of Virochana, is performing a supreme sacrifice, O Vishnu. Before the completion of his vow, you must fulfill our purpose."'
'8': '"He grants whatever anyone requests of him, wherever and whenever they ask. He gives everything that is asked of him."'
'9': '"For the welfare of the gods, O Vishnu, assume an illusory form and take on the form of a dwarf. Do this great deed, O benefactor."'
'10': '"At that time, O Rama, Kashyapa, radiant like fire, along with Aditi, was blazing with great brilliance."'
'11': '"The divine couple, accompanied by the goddess, had completed a vow lasting a thousand divine years and praised Madhusudana, the bestower of boons."'
'12': '"O Supreme Being, composed of austerity, a repository of penance, and the very essence of asceticism, I perceive you through my intense austerities, O best of beings."'
'13': '"In your body, I see this entire world, O Lord. You are without beginning and beyond description, and I have taken refuge in you."'
'14': '"Pleased, Hari (Vishnu) spoke to Kashyapa, who was free from sin, ''Ask for a boon, O blessed one, for you are deserving of it.'''
'15': Hearing these words, Kashyapa spoke these words and asked for a boon that was sought by Aditi, the Devatas, and by my very self.
'16': '"O bestower of boons, you are capable of granting this boon. ''O sinless one, take birth as the son of Aditi and myself."'
'17': '"O slayer of Asuras, be the younger brother of Indra, and help the distressed gods. You are capable of helping the devas struck by grief!'
'18': '"By your grace, this place will be called Siddhashrama. O Lord of Gods, once your task is accomplished, rise from here."'
'19': Then, the greatly powerful Vishnu was born in Aditi as Vamana and approached Bali, the son of Virochana.
'20': He begged for three paces of land and, having accepted the earth, covered the worlds for the welfare of all and to benefit the universe.
'21': With great power, he subdued Bali and restored the three worlds under the rule of Indra, bringing them back under his control.
'22': '"This hermitage was once occupied by him (Vamana), and it is now free from afflictions. Due to my devotion, I also reside here in Vamana''s hermitage."'
'23': '"Demons, intent on causing hindrances, frequently come to this hermitage. Here, O tiger among men, those evildoers are to be slain.'
'24': '"Today, O Rama, we shall go to the supreme Siddhashrama. This hermitage will now belong to you as well, just as it is mine."'
'25': Speaking thus, greatly pleased, Vishwamitra took Rama and Lakshmana and entered the hermitage, shining like the moon freed from mist, accompanied by Punarvasu.
'26': Seeing him, all the sages residing in Siddhashrama rose quickly to greet Vishwamitra and paid their respects.
'27': They performed worship to the wise Vishwamitra as was appropriate and also extended hospitality to the two princes.
'28': 'After resting for a while, the two princes, the subduers of enemies, addressed the eminent sage with joined palms:'
'29': '"Be consecrated today itself, O revered one. May success attend you, and may this Siddhashrama become complete. May your words come true."'
'30': Thus addressed, the greatly powerful Vishwamitra, the eminent sage, entered into his vow of consecration with controlled senses.
'31': The two princes spent that night there in great concentration, and at dawn, they rose and performed their morning prayers.
'32': Having completed the supreme chant and performed the fire offering with proper rites, they then offered their respects to the seated Vishwamitra."
'-1': Thus is the 29th chapter in the Childhood Section of the Valmiki Ramayanam, named 'Shiddhashrama'.
