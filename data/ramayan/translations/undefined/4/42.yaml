'0': Now begins the section known as Pratichīprēṣaṇa in the Kishkindhā Kāṇḍa of the august Valmiki Ramayana, a segment composed of forty‐two chapters, signifying the sacred commencement.
'1': Then, having arranged the order, Sugrīva—the beloved companion of Hārī—directed himself toward the south and addressed the monkey Sūṣena, also known by the epithet of Meghasaṅkāśa.
'2': With folded hands, he saluted and spoke to the illustrious figure, the father of Tārā and the revered father-in-law, the mighty Bhīmavikrama.
'3': He further extolled the renowned son of a great sage, Mārīca—esteemed as a mighty monkey—whose valor and radiance, as acclaimed by the foremost of the monkey hosts, shone with brilliance comparable to that of Indra.
'4': Endowed with both intelligence and physical prowess, he glimmered with a divine resplendence akin to that of the celestials, and was celebrated among the sons of Mārīca and the mighty, valiant heroes.
'5': He then commanded all those scions of the sages—the very best of the monkey warriors, numbering in hundreds of thousands on both flanks—to commence on the appointed march.
'6': O illustrious ones! Led by Sūṣena, proceed along the path to Vaidehī in company with those from the land of Saurāṣṭra, the limbs-bearing and the moonlike figures alike.
'7': Adorned with broad, well-smeared anjanā footprints and resplendent, ancient ornaments, the host advanced like a coiled serpent through groves profuse with bakula and uddalā trees.
'8': Likewise, the retinue festooned with ketaka pennants and bearing Hari’s standard advanced along the road, while before them flowed clear rivers of cool, sanctifying water.
'9': In that region, where ascetics’ dwellings and wilderness mountains abounded, the earth itself was adorned with frost-like, lofty stones reminiscent of winter’s chill.
'10': Traversing through rugged forts enveloped by groves and hills, they directed themselves toward the west, and upon reaching that western expanse, beheld the vast ocean as befits their sacred journey.
'11': Having crossed the waters of Timinakrākula, the monkeys observed, among groves embellished with ketaka banners and within dense tamāla forests, landscapes of wondrous beauty.
'12': They were destined to dwell in coconut groves, where the route to Sītā’s abode, as well as to that of Rāvaṇa, was clearly traced out.
'13': Within the valleys and upon the mountains and in the forests, splendid cities such as Muravīpattana and the delightful Jatapura shone forth in their ancient grandeur.
'14': Thus, proceeding through lands marked with auspicious signs and traversing vast, splendid forests and expansive regions replete with monumental cities, the host advanced in firm array.
'15': At the confluence of the Sindhu and Sāgara flows, there rose a mountain known as Somagiri—the great peak also hailed as the Hundred-Horned, akin to a mighty mahā-tree.
'16': There, among the beautiful gatherings, lions and agile birds were stationed, while even the resplendent elephants bore their burdens with dignified grace.
'17': The lofty abodes atop the mountain peaks, which served as the resting places of the lions, resonated with the fulfilled aspirations of the elephants, whose roars and harmonious calls echoed throughout.
'18': They roamed freely throughout that vast, splendid region—whose peaks shone by day like golden spires and whose terrains were as exquisitely adorned as works of art.
'19': Promptly, the monkeys of ideal form hastened to execute their duty, for before them stretched an ocean spanning a hundred yojanas, resplendent in its golden radiance.
'20': Undeterred by the perilous expedition, the monkeys set forth and beheld, in innumerable multitudes, twenty-four divisions of celestial beings—the Gandharvas and the wondrous Taras—their presence a benediction.
'21': Also assembled were those of fierce aspect, resembling blazing flames and possessing a formidable, warlike form, whose brilliance shone with the dazzling luster of lightning all around.
'22': These brave heroes, endowed with noble virtue and mighty strength, without ever yielding, vigilantly guarded the abundant, life-sustaining bounties of that land.
'23': There, with unwavering effort, the path for Sītā must be fashioned so that no fear may befall her; indeed, the troop of monkeys proceeded in steadfast unison.
'24': In that very locale stood a magnificent mountain of a lustrous, electric hue, firmly established like a mighty thunderbolt—its form interwoven with diverse creepers and trees—and it was known by the name Vajra, the great peak.
'25': Within that splendid region, an expanse of a hundred yojanas was gathered, wherein secret treasures lay hidden; the fleets were to be navigated with utmost care and earnest exertion.
'26': In one of the four quadrants of the ocean stood a venerable mountain called Chakravān, upon which a wheel with a thousand spokes had been fashioned by the divine architect Viśvakarma.
'27': There, by slaying five illustrious beings as well as the demon Hayagrīva, the Supreme Man seized a formidable wheel and a resounding conch emblematic of his valor.
'28': Among his celestial retinue in those magnificent and vast abodes, Rāvaṇa, accompanied by Vaidehī herself, was set in motion along the prescribed path with deliberation.
'29': There stood a mountain known as Varāha, extending sixty yojanas in breadth, crowned with a glorious golden peak; its radiance glimmered in the magnificent abode of Varuṇa, the sovereign of the waters.
'30': In that ancient city called Jyotiṣa—distinct in its peculiar form—there dwelt a wicked, man-like demon, notorious for his evil disposition.
'31': Within those charming, spacious abodes, once again Rāvaṇa, accompanied by Vaidehī, was ordered to proceed along the preordained route.
'32': Surmounting the mountain’s heights with a vision suffused by golden splendour, the entire peak, abundant in golden lustre, cascaded forth like a profusion of brilliant streams.
'33': All around, elephants, wild boars, lions, and tigers roared mightily, their tremendous voices echoing in unison and instilling awe in all who heard them.
'34': Upon that majestic mountain, where the cherished Hārī’s benefactor Mahendra ruled with royal authority, there reigned an anointed sovereign among the gods, known as Megha.
'35': Having ascended further, the mountain—under the vigilant guardianship of Mahendra—witnessed a procession of sixty thousand golden peaks, as if parading under divine command.
'36': All around shone a youthful, sun-like radiance in resplendent hues, while trees of diverse forms, bedecked with exquisite blossoms, enhanced the scene with their pulchritude.
'37': Amidst these resplendent manifestations stood King Meru, the eminent summit among mountains, graciously endowed by the brilliance of the sun and bestowing celestial boons in times of old.
'38': Thus the mountain was declared to be entirely under thy auspicious protection; by thy grace, both by day and by night, all its abodes shall shine with a golden luster.
'39': And those who take refuge in thee—be they gods, gandharvas, or even daityas—shall in time become devoted, their beings aglow with the resplendence of divine, golden light.
'40': The lord of all deities, the Vasu, and the Maruts of the celestial realms, having approached from the west at twilight, reached the exalted and peerless Mount Meru.
'41': There, enthroned by Aditya and revered as the sun itself, the mountain, though unseen by mortal eyes, ascended in majestic retreat from the assembly of all beings.
'42': As countless as a thousand yojanas and measured in tenfold proportions, the radiant Sun, traversing in half a muhūrta, swiftly reached that massive heap of solid rock.
'43': Atop that peak stood a magnificent, divine edifice, resplendent like the sun, adorned with a multitude of palatial structures fashioned by the ingenious hand of Viśvakarma.
'44': Its beauty, enhanced by radiant beams and myriad birds in flight, marked it as the dwelling of the noble Varuṇa—the exalted one whose very hands are bound by fate.
'45': Between the lofty Mount Meru and a vast lake crowned with ten great summits, there emerged an illustrious, town-like formation, resplendent as if laid out on an exquisitely decorated platform.
'46': Within all those fortresses, serene pools, and flowing rivers, Rāvaṇa, accompanied by Vaidehī, was at once instructed to proceed along the designated and sacred path.
'47': There dwells one who is deeply versed in dharma, imbued with austerity and introspection—a figure renowned as Meru-sāvṛṇi, esteemed by Brahmā himself.
'48': The venerable Meru-sāvṛṇi, illustrious as the sun in splendor, was saluted with deep reverence upon the earth, and thus commenced his journey toward Maithilī.
'49': Thus, the radiant luminary—the life-giver even as night recedes—having dispelled all obscurity, steadily ascended the mountain in unwavering progress.
'50': In this manner the monkey chiefs, endowed with formidable might, found themselves capable of advancing, for they knew no bounds to the illustrious brilliance of the celestial luminary.
'51': Yet, having discerned the dwelling of Vaidehī and that of Rāvaṇa, they reached the mountain at dusk, and as the month reached its fullness, they accordingly withdrew.
'52': O thou, whose dwelling is exalted above all, even as the valiant abide, know that my revered father-in-law shall proceed in union with those heroic souls.
'53': All these matters must be duly heard and observed by thy appointed emissaries; for this venerable, mighty hero, my illustrious father-in-law, is possessed of unsurpassable strength.
'54': And ye too, being illustrious and mighty in your deeds, serve as the living evidence of these truths; thus, firmly established as a sign, observe thenceforth the direction of the west.
'55': Behold the consort of the king of men, resplendent in her immeasurable glory—by her consecrated deeds, the reward of her labours shall duly be manifested.
'56': Therefore, whatever further task that is dear to his heart, pertaining to the accomplishment of this work, must be collectively arranged with your own, according to the prescribed time and regional ordinance.
'57': Then, led by the foremost Sūṣena, the fleet of monkeys—well-versed in Sugrīva’s counsel, having been summoned—assembled before the commander of the fleet and proceeded in the direction ordained by Varuṇa.
'-1': Thus concludes the elaborate dispatch in the Pratichīprēṣaṇa section of the Kishkindhā Kāṇḍa in the revered Valmiki Ramayana, the ancient and exalted epic.
