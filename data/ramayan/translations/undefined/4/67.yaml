'0': Thus begins the sixty-seventh chapter, named "The Leap of Hanuman," in the Kishkindha Kanda of the sacred Ramayana composed by the sage Valmiki.
'1': Seeing Hanuman, the foremost of the Vanaras, preparing to leap a hundred yojanas with great speed, the Vanaras were filled with joy and admiration.
'2': Instantly casting aside their sorrow, they were filled with delight and praised the mighty Hanuman.
'3': Filled with joy and wonder, they gazed all around at Hanuman, who was ready to perform a feat like that of the divine Narayana's Trivikrama.
'4': Praised by the Vanaras, Hanuman, the mighty one, grew in strength and joyfully waved his tail, gaining even more power.
'5': As the elder Vanaras praised him, Hanuman's form, filled with radiance, became unparalleled.
'6': Just as a lion stretches in a mountain cave, so did Hanuman, the son of the wind god, stretch himself.
'7': His face, as he stretched, shone like the brilliant, smokeless fire, resembling the splendor of the sun.
'8': Emerging from the midst of the Vanaras, his body hair standing on end with joy, Hanuman respectfully addressed the elder Vanaras.
'9': '"The wind, the friend of fire, is strong, immeasurable, and moves through the sky, uprooting mountain peaks.'
'10': I am the son of that swift-moving, great-souled wind god, and I am equal to him in speed and flight.
'11': I am capable of encircling the vast Meru mountain thousands of times, as if drawing a line in the sky.
'12': With the force of my arms, I can flood the world, along with its mountains, rivers, and lakes, with the ocean.
'13': The ocean, the abode of Varuna, will rise with great crocodiles due to the force of my thighs and calves.
'14': I am capable of encircling Garuda, the eater of serpents, who is served by birds in the sky, thousands of times.
'15': I am capable of reaching the ever-radiant sun, which rises from the east, adorned with rays, without setting.
'16': Without touching the earth, I am capable of returning with great speed, like a mighty storm, O best of Vanaras.
'17': I am capable of surpassing all sky-dwellers, drying up the oceans, and splitting the earth.
'18': I will crush mountains while leaping, and with my great speed, I will carry away the mighty ocean.
'19': The various flowers of creepers and trees will follow me today as I leap through the sky.
'20': My path will be like that of the star Swati in the sky, as I traverse the terrifying sky and leap upwards.
'21': All beings will see me descending, O Vanaras, like the great Meru mountain, and you will see me, O Vanaras.
'22': As I cover the sky, appearing to swallow the heavens, I will scatter the clouds, shake the mountains, and dry up the ocean while leaping with concentration.
'23': Except for Garuda, the king of birds, or the mighty wind god, I see no being that can follow me in my leap.
'24': In the blink of an eye, I will suddenly descend from the sky, unsupported, like lightning emerging from a cloud.
'25': My form while leaping over the ocean will be like that of Vishnu's three strides.
'26': With my intellect and mental resolve, I will see Sita, and you, O Vanaras, rejoice.
'27': Equal to the wind in speed and to Garuda in swiftness, I am determined to travel ten thousand yojanas.
'28': I will swiftly bring back the nectar from the hands of Indra, armed with the thunderbolt, or from Brahma, the self-born.
'29': I am determined to lift Lanka and return, or so I think.
'30': Hearing these words of Hanuman, the best of Vanaras, the Vanaras there were filled with joy and wonder.
'31': Hearing his words, which dispelled the sorrow of his kin, Jambavan, the king of the Vanaras, joyfully spoke.
'32': '"O valiant son of Kesari, swift one, son of the wind god, you have dispelled the great sorrow of your kin.'
'33': The foremost of the Vanaras, eager for your welfare, have gathered here.
'34': With the blessings of the sages and the wisdom of the elder Vanaras, they will perform auspicious rites for the success of your mission.
'35': With the blessings of the elders, cross the great ocean. We will stand on one foot until your return.
'36': The lives of all the forest-dwelling Vanaras depend on you.
'37': Then, the tiger among Vanaras spoke to the forest-dwellers.
'38': '"No one in the world can match my speed in leaping.'
'39': These peaks of this mountain, Mahendra, are stable and large, and I will leap with speed on these peaks of Mahendra.
'40': Covered with various trees and adorned with minerals, these great peaks will support my speed as I leap a hundred yojanas from here.
'41': Then, like the wind, the Vanara, son of the wind god, ascended the great mountain Mahendra, the crusher of enemies.
'42': Covered with various flowers, frequented by deer, with lush grass, and filled with creepers and flowers, it bore trees that always bore flowers and fruits.
'43': Inhabited by lions and tigers, frequented by intoxicated elephants, resounding with the cries of intoxicated birds, and filled with water bodies.
'44': The great mountain Mahendra, with its lofty peaks, was roamed by the best of Vanaras, who was equal in prowess to Mahendra.
'45': Pressed by the feet of the great-souled Hanuman, the great mountain roared like a lion struck by a mighty elephant.
'46': It released water bodies, scattered its rocky peaks, frightened the deer and elephants, and shook its great trees.
'47': With various Gandharva couples, harsh with the influence of wine, and with birds flying, and even with groups of Vidyadharas.
'48': The great mountain, with its lofty peaks, was abandoned by the frightened sages, like a traveler without a caravan in a great forest.
'49': The mighty Hanuman, the destroyer of enemies, with his mind focused and his great speed, set his mind on Lanka and leaped with determination.
'-1': Thus ends the sixty-seventh chapter, named "The Leap of Hanuman," in the Kishkindha Kanda of the sacred Ramayana composed by the sage Valmiki.
