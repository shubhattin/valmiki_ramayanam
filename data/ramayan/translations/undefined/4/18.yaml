'0': Thus begins the eighteenth sarga of the Kishkindha Kanda in the illustrious Valmiki Ramayana, called the 'Destruction of Vali', wherein the divine narrative unfolds.
'1': Thus was pronounced the well-supported, wholesome discourse imbued with the essence of dharma and artha; and the indomitable Rama, resolute in spirit, declared against Vali the mighty one.
'2': As one diminished of radiance as the sun deprived of its brilliance and like a drop released freely from a cloud, the words of the foremost Hari descended upon him as a cooling, quenching flame.
'3': Endowed with the qualities of dharma, artha and unsurpassed virtue, the Lord of Hari—having been charged with this sacred mandate—then addressed Vali, who had come before him.
'4': Unmindful of the fact that the world is governed by dharma, artha and kāma alike, how can you, in your youthful state, forsake the eternal precepts and renounce your duty?
'5': Having sought the counsel of the wise and venerable elders, the gentle vanara now aspires to express his words to me, earnestly desiring to communicate his resolve.
'6': This very earth – the realm of the Ikshvakus, adorned with lofty mountains, groves and forests – is also held in the gracious custody that even restrains the actions of wild creatures, birds, and men.
'7': Behold Bharata, the virtuous and truthful one, endowed with an intimate knowledge of dharma, kāma and artha, who cherishes the discipline of restraint in his governance.
'8': In him reside both resolution and humility, with truth firmly established; as his valour shone forth, the king became renowned throughout his realm and across all ages.
'9': In obedience to his injunction to practice dharma, we, the earth-bound beings, traverse this entire world, aspiring to be the progeny nurtured in the light of righteousness.
'10': Within that regal assembly, dear to Bharata and devoted to dharma, the protector upholds the whole earth, cherished by those who revere righteousness.
'11': Though we may wander astray in our individual ways, steadfast in our own dharma we remain; let us then, in accordance with Bharata’s command, adhere to the prescribed order.
'12': But you, entangled in a miasma of distorted duty and misdirected deeds, driven chiefly by desire and cunning stratagems, are unworthy to occupy a station in the royal order.
'13': Be it the elder, the brother, or the father who imparts knowledge, these three figures are to be revered as paternal guides for those who walk the path of dharma.
'14': Likewise, whether one’s own son or a learned disciple whose virtues shine forth, all three together form the foundation and the very raison d’être of dharma.
'15': The dharma of the virtuous, subtle and most unfathomable in its depth, acts as a buoy in the heart of all beings, discerning the auspicious from the inauspicious.
'16': Among the restless and hurried vanaras, who, as if clouded by ignorance of caste, engage in incantations in their bewildered state, what is it that you truly perceive?
'17': I now articulate these words with clarity to you; you are not entitled to challenge me solely on account of anger.
'18': 'Behold the reason: for, in effect, you have been vanquished by my hand—having abandoned your sacred duty to your brother and wife, you renounce the eternal dharma.'
'19': O noble Sugriva, consider that in Rumāya you pursue base desires and engage in sinful deeds contrary to dharma.
'20': For that vanara who once indulged in desire at the cost of dharma, his misdeeds in matters concerning brother and wife have warranted the imposition of this very penalty.
'21': Surely, the one who stands in opposition to worldly norms and whose conduct is unworthy, must be met with corrective discipline—akin to the reining in observed from Hari-yūtha.
'22': Nor do I reproach you for transgressions, for you are born of the noble Kshatriya lineage, whether it concerns your sister, your wife, or your younger kin.
'23': A man might declare that one guilty of lust deserves punishment and even death; yet, Bharata—the sovereign of the earth—and we, as executors of your command, shall see that justice prevails.
'24': And you, having crossed the bounds of righteousness, how can you expect to be overlooked? A wise one who transcends even the dharma of his teacher must steadfastly uphold righteousness.
'25': While Bharata himself regulates those driven by desire, we, having executed Bharata’s directive, are properly arranged to enforce your diverse and distinct ordinances.
'26': In the same way that I cherish the friendship of Sugriva and the association of Lakshmana, it is undeniably auspicious for the sake of the kingdom’s administration.
'27': Furthermore, having given my solemn vow in the presence of the vanaras, how could I ever neglect to observe that pledge in a proper manner?
'28': By these manifold reasons, and with the support of mighty adherents of dharma, may your governance, as is duly appropriate, be sanctioned by your own decree.
'29': In every respect, it is imperative to behold dharma; for the duty incumbent upon one’s station is to observe and practice righteousness without fail.
'30': Indeed, you too are capable of fulfilling this task in keeping with dharma; as it is recounted in the verses of Manu—in two eloquent slokas rich in virtuous character—which I have received and enacted with the skill of the righteous.
'31': By the punishments administered by kings wielding their rods, sinners among men—once purified—attain the heavenly abode, just as the virtuous ascend to a state of transcendence.
'32': Whether through the administration of governance or by the boon of liberation, one may be freed from the stain of sin; yet a king who rules inevitably accrues a measure of defilement.
'33': O noble one, consider my own affliction wrought by my wife’s heedless actions—a dire torment akin to that suffered by a penitent ascetic; similarly, sin was committed by you through your own endeavors.
'34': Likewise, sins committed by others—through the negligence of worldly sovereigns—are often expiated by proper acts of atonement, thus cleansing the residue of unrighteousness.
'35': Thus, conceived with profound distress in accordance with dharma, the execution by the vanara’s arm has been ordained; we are not disposed to alter this destined course by our own will.
'36': Hear now, O Hari-Pungava, another cause and reason; having listened to it, no great hero should assume that he is justified in acting contrary to it.
'37': For I harbor no inner distress here, nor do I deem it proper for you, O Hari-Pungava, since many men—armed with words, cords, and various bonds—are present in this tumult of affairs.
'38': Both those who hide and those clearly visible seize the deer at daybreak; whether they are caught in a headlong rush, alarmed and scattered, all meet with the same fate.
'39': Even if men, in their heedlessness or in deep distraction while pursuing flesh, exhibit a certain reluctance, no blame may be assigned here to any who turn away.
'40': Here, even royal sages and seers skilled in dharma, as well as those well-versed in the science of righteousness, proceed in pursuit; therefore, in battle you—O vanara—are felled by my arrow, whether you resist or counterattack, for you are rendered as fleeting as a branch of a deer.
'41': In matters as rare as true dharma, the sustenance of life and auspicious fortune, kings are indeed the supreme bestowers, and among vanaras none can rival their generosity.
'42': They should not be harmed, nor should words of rebuke or disdain be directed at them; for these beings, whether in divine form or as ordinary men, traverse the vast expanse of the earth.
'43': Yet you, in your ignorance of true dharma and standing ensnared solely in wrath, do mock me in the realm of dharma as handed down by our revered ancestors.
'44': Thus spoke Rama, and although Vali was greatly aggrieved by these words, Raghava attributed no fault to you, for the path of righteousness had been secured beyond any doubt.
'45': Thereupon, with palms joined in reverence, the lord of the vanaras addressed Rama, declaring, 'That which you have spoken, O foremost among men, is indeed beyond question.'
'46': For one who is not of noble character cannot readily offer a rejoinder; the words I uttered earlier in my moment of carelessness were indeed not meant to be pleasing.
'47': Moreover, in that very matter, O Raghava, you have no cause to lay blame upon me; for you, being perceptive of underlying truths and ever devoted to the welfare of the people, possess an unblemished intellect that flawlessly accomplishes both means and ends.
'48': Furthermore, even though my own conduct—understood as a departure from conventional dharma—has been extolled, it should be safeguarded by one well-versed in dharma, through both learned speech and the established code of righteousness.
'49': With a throat as though stifled by condensed steam and in a deep, resounding tone, Vali spoke slowly while beholding Rama, his visage appearing as if besmirched with mud, like a man from a distant island.
'50': I grieve not for my own self, nor do I lament the stars or my kinsmen—just as I do not mourn for my eldest and virtuous son, Angada, resplendent as pure gold.
'51': Ashamed by my own appearance, having grown from a humble childhood into a charming youth, I shall, like the sun drying a yellow cloud of dew, soon reach the destined shore.
'52': My youthful wisdom and my one beloved son are now entrusted to your protection, O Rama, the incomparable and mighty guardian.
'53': Likewise, Sugriva and Angada, endowed with an excellent intellect, are entrusted by divine ordinance to you; for you are the steadfast protector and the revered preceptor in all matters of duty and approved conduct.
'54': That mode of conduct, O lord of men—esteemed by Lakshmana and by yourself, and recognized by Sugriva and Angada—is indeed worthy of deliberation concerning the governance of the kingdom.
'55': Just as one who has incurred faults by his own misdeeds would not see another ascend to the lofty station of an ascetic, so too should Sugriva not be accorded any alternative status.
'56': By your gracious favor the kingdom is attainable; for while you remain in command, your heart follows your every directive with steadfast devotion.
'57': It is indeed possible for you to secure the heavens and govern the earth; and from you I too, aspiring for rulership, seek to obtain a share of that sovereign strength.
'58': Accompanied by Sugriva, my own brother has now taken up arms in the struggle; having thus spoken, the vanara took his leave of Rama, the lord of Hari.
'59': Then Rama, in a tone of gentle reassurance and with an unmistakable manifestation of his presence, addressed Vali with words imbued with approval from the virtuous and imbued with the essence of dharma.
'60': Fear not, for you need not be agitated over this matter; neither you nor I, O best of men, shall be disturbed, for in all things pertaining to you, we are steadfastly resolved in the path of dharma.
'61': He who is struck by the rod, or who himself becomes the rod, thereby fulfilling both cause and effect in the performance of duty—indeed, neither of these principles is absent.
'62': O thou, by the union of punishment and consequence, are now rendered free from reproach; having renounced your former nature, you abide in the noble course prescribed by the rod of dharma.
'63': Abandon, then, the sorrow, delusion, and fear entrenched in your heart; for by your own decree, O foremost among men, it is impossible to proceed in any manner contrary to the ordained method.
'64': Just as you, like the ever-dutiful Angada, constantly conduct yourself as the lord of the vanaras, so too must Sugriva remain steadfastly by my side without any doubt.
'65': Then his words, sweet and fully attuned to the path of dharma, were declared in unison; and upon hearing Rama’s fierce battle cry, the vanara, self-assured in his own merit, upheld his duty.
'66': With a throat scorched by the arrows and a mind resolved and unwavering, I have thus spoken to you, O illustrious one; may you forgive me, for this tremendous, awe-inspiring valor—reminiscent of Mahendra—has been graciously conferred upon you.
'-1': Thus concludes the eighteenth sarga, known as the 'Destruction of Vali', in the Valmiki Ramayana, the great ancient epic, as recounted in the Kishkindha Kanda.
