'0': Thus begins the fifth chapter, named "Sugriva's Friendship," in the Kishkindha Kanda of the sacred Ramayana composed by the sage Valmiki.
'1': Hanuman, having departed from Rishyamuka, went to the Malaya mountain and informed the monkey king about the two valiant princes, Rama and Lakshmana.
'2': This is Rama, of great wisdom and firm valor, who has arrived here with his brother Lakshmana. This Rama is truly valiant.
'3': Born in the Ikshvaku dynasty, Rama is the son of King Dasharatha, renowned for his adherence to dharma and obedience to his father's commands.
'4': Through Rajasuya and Ashvamedha sacrifices, he has satisfied the sacred fire and has given away countless cows as charity.
'5': By his penance and truthfulness, he has protected the earth. For the sake of a woman, his son Rama has come to the forest.
'6': While residing in the forest, the noble Rama, who is disciplined, had his wife abducted by Ravana, and now he seeks refuge in you.
'7': Desiring friendship with you, these two brothers, Rama and Lakshmana, should be received and honored by you, for they are most worthy of reverence.
'8': Hearing Hanuman's words, Sugriva, the lord of the monkeys, became exceedingly pleased and spoke to Rama with joy.
'9': You are disciplined in dharma, a great ascetic, and compassionate to all. The son of the wind god has truthfully narrated your virtues to me.
'10': Therefore, it is my great honor and supreme gain, O Lord, that you wish to form a bond of friendship with me, a monkey.
'11': If this friendship pleases you, here is my extended arm. Let our hands be clasped, and let a firm bond be established.
'12': Hearing these well-spoken words of Sugriva, Rama, with a delighted heart, clasped his hand with his own.
'13': Joyfully embracing the bond of friendship, he embraced Sugriva tightly. Then Hanuman, the vanquisher of foes, discarded his mendicant guise.
'14': With his own form, he kindled a fire between two pieces of wood. Then, worshipping the blazing fire with flowers, he honored it.
'15': With great devotion, he placed it between them. Then, both of them circumambulated the blazing fire.
'16': Sugriva and Rama thus became friends. Thereafter, both the monkey and the prince, with delighted hearts,
'17': gazed at each other without satiation. You are my dear friend, and indeed, our joy and sorrow are one.
'18': Sugriva, with great delight, spoke these words to Rama. Then, breaking a well-flowered branch of a Sala tree,
'19': Sugriva spread it out and sat down with Rama. Then, Hanuman, the son of the wind god, joyfully gave a highly flowered branch of a sandalwood tree to Lakshmana.
'20': Then, with great joy, Sugriva, with gentle and sweet words,
'21': spoke to Rama, his eyes filled with tears of joy. O Rama, I wander here, deceived and terrified,
'22': my wife abducted, I dwell in this impenetrable forest, fearful and with a disturbed mind.
'23': Deceived by my brother Vali, and having enmity with him, O Rama, grant me, who is tormented by fear of Vali, your protection.
'24': You should act, O descendant of Kakutstha, so that I may be free from fear. Thus addressed, the illustrious Rama, knower of dharma and lover of dharma,
'25': replied to Sugriva with a smile. The fruit of help, O great monkey, is known to me.
'26': I shall slay that Vali, who has abducted your wife. My sharp arrows, resembling the sun, are unfailing.
'27': They shall swiftly fall upon that wicked Vali, covered with peacock feathers, resembling the thunderbolt of Indra.
'28': With sharp tips and straight shafts, they are like angry serpents. Today, see that Vali, struck down by arrows resembling venomous snakes,
'29': lying on the ground, scattered like a mountain. Hearing these words of Rama, beneficial to himself, Sugriva, exceedingly pleased, spoke these supreme words.
'30': By your grace, O lion among men, O hero, may I regain my beloved and my kingdom. Therefore, O king of men, deal with my enemy in such a way that he may not harm my elder brother again.
'31': In the context of Sugriva and Rama's friendship, the eyes, resembling lotus and gold, of the protectors of Sita and the monkey king, simultaneously twitch.
'-1': Thus ends the fifth chapter, named "Sugriva's Friendship," in the Kishkindha Kanda of the sacred Ramayana composed by the sage Valmiki.
