'0': Thus begins the forty-ninth chapter of the Aranyakanda of the glorious Ramayana composed by sage Valmiki, known as the abduction of Sita.
'1': Hearing the words of Sita, the mighty ten-headed Ravana, clapped his hands together and displayed his great form.
'2': The eloquent Ravana spoke again to Maithili, "I believe you have not heard of my valor and prowess, as you seem to be mad."
'3': '"I can lift the earth with my arms while standing in the sky, drink the ocean, and slay death itself in battle."'
'4': '"I can pierce the sun with sharp arrows and split the earth. O mad one, behold me, who can assume any form at will."'
'5': As Ravana, whose eyes were red with anger, spoke thus, his eyes became like the red end of a monkey's tail.
'6': Immediately, Ravana, abandoning his gentle form, assumed his fierce form, resembling the form of death, the brother of Kubera.
'7': With blood-red eyes, adorned with blazing golden ornaments, filled with great anger, he resembled a dark cloud.
'8': The ten-headed, twenty-armed night-stalker, abandoning the guise of an ascetic, assumed his massive form.
'9': Ravana, the lord of the Rakshasas, assumed his own form, wearing red garments, and stood gazing at the jewel among women, Maithili.
'10': Ravana spoke to Maithili, who was adorned with garments and ornaments, and whose dark hair resembled the rays of the sun.
'11': '"If you desire a husband renowned in the three worlds, O lady of lovely hips, take refuge in me, for I am a suitable husband for you."'
'12': '"Serve me for a long time, for I am a praiseworthy husband for you, and I will never do anything unpleasant to you, O auspicious one."'
'13': '"Abandon your human emotions and direct your feelings towards me. Forsake Rama, who is deprived of his kingdom, unsuccessful, and of limited lifespan."'
'14': '"O foolish one, who considers herself wise, by what qualities are you attached to him, who abandoned his kingdom and friends at the words of a woman?"'
'15': '"That evil-minded one resides in this forest, inhabited by wild beasts." Thus speaking to Maithili, who deserved kind words, the wicked Ravana, deluded by desire, approached her.'
'16': The wicked Ravana, deluded by desire, approached Maithili, who deserved kind words, and seized her, like Budha seizing Rohini in the sky.
'17': With his left hand, he grasped the lotus-eyed Sita by her hair, and with his right hand, he seized her thighs.
'18': Seeing him, who resembled a mountain peak, with sharp fangs and mighty arms, the forest deities, terrified, fled, as if seeing death itself.
'19': Then, the divine chariot of Ravana, yoked with mules, with the sound of mules, and adorned with gold, appeared.
'20': Then, threatening Vaidehi with harsh words, the loud-voiced Ravana placed her on his lap and mounted the chariot.
'21': The illustrious Sita, seized by Ravana, cried out in distress, "O Rama!" as she was carried away into the forest, far from Rama.
'22': Ravana, afflicted by desire, carried away the unwilling Sita, who struggled like the wife of the serpent king, and flew up into the sky.
'23': Then, as she was being carried away by the king of the Rakshasas through the sky, she cried out loudly, like a madwoman, her mind bewildered with distress.
'24': '"O Lakshmana, mighty-armed one, who pleases the mind of the guru, you do not know that I am being carried away by a Rakshasa who can assume any form."'
'25': '"O Raghava, abandoning life, happiness, and wealth for the sake of righteousness, you do not see me being carried away unrighteously."'
'26': '"O subduer of foes, are you not the chastiser of the insolent? How do you not restrain Ravana, who is committing such a sinful act?"'
'27': '"The result of an insolent act is not seen immediately, but time also becomes a factor, as in the ripening of crops."'
'28': '"You have committed this act, your mind overcome by time, and you will meet with a terrible end, bringing about your death at the hands of Rama."'
'29': '"Now, Kaikeyi, along with her relatives, will be pleased, for I, the virtuous wife of the righteous one, am being carried away."'
'30': '"I bid farewell to the Karnikaras in Janasthana, who are in full bloom. Quickly inform Rama that Ravana is abducting Sita."'
'31': '"I bow to the Godavari river, resounding with the cries of swans and cranes. Quickly inform Rama that Ravana is abducting Sita."'
'32': '"I bow to the deities in this forest, with its various trees. I bow to them, asking them to inform my lord that I have been abducted."'
'33': '"I take refuge in all the creatures here, whatever they may be, the various animals and birds."'
'34': '"Inform my lord, who is dearer to me than life itself, that Sita, helpless, has been abducted by Ravana."'
'35': '"The mighty-armed one, knowing this, will bring me back, even if I am taken by Yama himself, with his great strength."'
'36': Then, as she lamented with pitiful words, filled with great sorrow, the wide-eyed Sita saw a vulture perched on a tree.
'37': Seeing him, the beautiful Sita, under the control of Ravana, cried out in fear, her voice choked with sorrow.
'38': '"O noble Jatayu, see me being carried away like an orphan by this merciless, sinful Rakshasa king."'
'39': '"You cannot restrain this cruel night-stalker, who is strong, deceitful, and armed, with evil intentions."'
'40': '"O Jatayu, you must inform Rama and Lakshmana of my abduction by this Rakshasa, in its entirety."'
'-1': Thus ends the forty-ninth chapter of the Aranyakanda of the glorious Ramayana composed by sage Valmiki, known as the abduction of Sita.
