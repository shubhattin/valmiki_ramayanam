'1': Thus, having instructed his brother, the illustrious descendant of Raghu, Rama, of great splendor, girded on his sword, which was adorned with gold.
'2': Then, taking his bow, which was his own ornament, and fastening two quivers, he set out with great valor.
'3': The king of the forest, seeing the king approaching, became invisible out of fear, but soon reappeared.
'4': With his sword girded and bow in hand, he pursued the deer, which appeared to shine before him.
'5': Observing the deer running in the great forest, bow in hand, he was sometimes tempted by it, as if it were a supernatural being.
'6': The deer, appearing suspicious and agitated, seemed to leap into the sky, sometimes visible and sometimes invisible in certain parts of the forest.
'7': Like the autumnal moon veiled by scattered clouds, it was seen for a moment and then shone from afar.
'8': By its appearance and disappearance, the deer led Rama far from the hermitage, having assumed the form of a deer.
'9': Kakutstha, though angry, was rendered helpless by the illusion, and then, exhausted, he stood under the shade on the grass.
'10': The demon, in the form of a deer, enchanted him, and surrounded by other deer, appeared not far away.
'11': Seeing him eager to capture it, the deer again ran towards him, and then, out of fear, became invisible again.
'12': Once more, from a distance, it emerged from behind a clump of trees. Seeing it, the mighty Rama resolved to slay it.
'13': Then, drawing an arrow, resembling the rays of the sun, blazing and capable of crushing enemies, Rama, filled with anger, prepared to shoot.
'14': Fixing it on his strong bow, and drawing it with great force, he aimed at the deer, which seemed to breathe like a serpent.
'15': He released the blazing, fiery weapon, crafted by Brahma, which pierced the body of the deer-form.
'16': The arrow, resembling a thunderbolt, struck the heart of Maricha, and he, leaping a palm's length, fell down, greatly tormented.
'17': Uttering a dreadful sound, with little life remaining, Maricha, while dying, abandoned that illusory form.
'18': Recalling the words of the demon, he pondered how Lakshmana might be sent here, and Ravana might abduct Sita in the desolate place.
'19': Realizing the opportune moment, he then made a sound, resembling that of Rama, crying out, "O Sita! O Lakshmana!"
'20': Pierced in the vital part by the incomparable arrow, the deer-form was abandoned, and he assumed his demon form.
'21': Maricha, of great size, abandoning his life, assumed his demon form. Seeing him fallen on the ground, dreadful to behold,
'22': Rama, with limbs smeared with blood, writhing on the ground, thought of Sita and remembered Lakshmana's words.
'23': This was indeed the illusion of Maricha, as previously mentioned by Lakshmana, and now it has come to pass, for Maricha has been slain by me.
'24': Crying out loudly, "O Sita! O Lakshmana!" the demon died. How will Sita react upon hearing this?
'25': And the mighty-armed Lakshmana will be led into a state of desire. Thus thinking, the righteous Rama, with bristling hair,
'26': There, intense fear born of anxiety entered Rama, having slain the demon in deer form and hearing that sound.
'27': Having slain another deer and taking the meat, Rama, in haste, then proceeded towards the hermitage.
'-1': Thus ends the forty-fourth sarga, named "The Deception of Maricha," in the Aranya Kanda of the glorious Ramayana, composed by Valmiki, the first poet.
