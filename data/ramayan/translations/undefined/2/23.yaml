'1': Thus, when Rama spoke, Lakshmana, with his head bent down, quickly fell into a state of mixed dejection and joy, as if he were a man of great sorrow and delight.
'2': Then, the best among men, furrowing his brows in the middle, breathed heavily like a great serpent in a hole, filled with anger.
'3': His face, difficult to look at due to the furrowed brows, shone like the face of an angry lion.
'4': Waving his forearm like an elephant its trunk, he cast his glance sideways and upwards, shaking his head.
'5': Looking sideways with the corner of his eyes, he spoke to his brother, "This great confusion has arisen in you without reason."
'6': '"How can someone like you, who is not confused, speak in this manner, fearing the blame of unrighteousness and the world''s reproach?"'
'7': '"How can you, a valiant Kshatriya, speak of fate as weak and helpless, like a coward?"'
'8': '"How is it that you do not suspect those two sinful ones, who are intent on deceit under the guise of righteousness, O virtuous one?"'
'9': '"If their conduct was not deceitful, O Raghava, then the boon would have been granted to them long ago, and it would have been their natural right."'
'10': '"I cannot bear the initiation of the coronation of another, despised by the world, other than you, O hero. You must forgive me for that."'
'11': '"Even that righteousness, which has led your mind to this duality, is hateful to me, as it causes you to be deluded."'
'12': '"How can you, capable of action, follow the words of your father, who is under the control of Kaikeyi, which are unrighteous and blameworthy?"'
'13': '"Though this division has been made due to sin, it is not accepted. This causes me sorrow, and the association with unrighteousness is reprehensible."'
'14': '"This association with righteousness of yours is condemned by the world. How can you, even in thought, act according to the desires of those two, who are always hostile, though called parents?"'
'15': '"Even if your decision is divine and their opinion is also divine, it should be disregarded by you. I do not approve of it."'
'16': '"He who is weak and devoid of valor follows fate. The valiant, who are self-respecting, do not worship fate."'
'17': '"He who is capable of overcoming fate with human effort does not succumb to fate and does not despair."'
'18': '"Today, people will see the prowess of fate and the prowess of man. The distinction between fate and human effort will become clear today."'
'19': '"Today, people will see fate, defeated by my prowess, as they have seen the coronation thwarted by fate."'
'20': '"Like a wild elephant, restrained by a goad, I will turn back fate with my prowess."'
'21': '"Neither all the guardians of the world nor all the three worlds can prevent your coronation today, much less our father."'
'22': '"Those who have conspired to send you to the forest will themselves live in the forest for fourteen years."'
'23': '"I will burn the hope of our father and that of Kaikeyi, which is aimed at obstructing your coronation for the sake of her son''s kingdom."'
'24': '"The power of fate will not be equal to my power, which will cause grief, as my fierce prowess will prevail."'
'25': '"After a thousand years, the sons of noble lineage will rule the kingdom, and you will go to the forest."'
'26': '"The forest dwelling is prescribed according to the conduct of the ancient royal sages, after entrusting the subjects to the sons for protection."'
'27': '"If you, O virtuous one, do not desire the kingdom due to the fear of the disturbance of the royal order, then, O Rama, I promise you, O hero, that I will not partake in the hero''s world."'
'28': '"I will protect your kingdom like the ocean protects its shore."'
'29': '"Engage yourself in the auspicious coronation, and I alone will forcibly restrain the kings."'
'30': '"These arms are not for show, nor is the bow for decoration, nor is the sword for tying, nor are the arrows for support."'
'31': '"All these four are for the destruction of enemies, and I do not desire excessively that which is considered an enemy by me."'
'32': '"With a sharp-edged sword, shining like lightning, I do not consider even Indra, the wielder of the thunderbolt, as an enemy."'
'33': '"The earth will be filled with the crushed heads, arms, and thighs of elephants, horses, chariots, and men, like a dense forest."'
'34': '"Struck by the edge of my sword, the enemies will fall to the ground like clouds with lightning."'
'35': '"How can a man be considered a man among men when I, with my fingers protected by leather guards and bow in hand, stand ready?"'
'36': '"I will employ many arrows against one and one against many, targeting the vital parts of men, horses, and elephants."'
'37': '"Today, the power of my weapons will manifest, to make the king powerless and to establish your power, O lord."'
'38': '"Today, these arms, adorned with sandalwood paste, will perform the appropriate action of protecting friends and releasing wealth."'
'39': '"These arms of mine, O Rama, will perform the appropriate action of preventing those who obstruct your coronation."'
'40': '"Tell me, who should be deprived of life today, along with their friends and relatives, so that this earth may be under your control? Command me, for I am your servant."'
'41': Wiping his tears and consoling Lakshmana repeatedly, the enhancer of the Raghu lineage, spoke to him, who was resolved to follow the words of his father, "Listen to me, O gentle one, for this is indeed the path of righteousness."
