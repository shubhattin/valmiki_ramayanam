'1': Thus showing Sita the river flowing through the mountains, he sat on the mountain slope, delighting Sita with meat.
'2': This is pure, this is delicious, this is well-cooked by fire. Thus, the righteous Raghava sat with Sita.
'3': As they were sitting there, the dust and sound of Bharata's approaching army, touching the sky, appeared.
'4': In the meantime, frightened by the great sound, the leaders of the herds, along with their groups, ran in all directions.
'5': Raghava heard the sound raised by the army and saw all the leaders of the herds fleeing.
'6': Seeing them fleeing and hearing the sound, Rama spoke to Lakshmana, the one with blazing energy.
'7': O Lakshmana, son of Sumitra, behold here! A tumultuous sound, deep as thunder, is heard.
'8': In the forest, the herds of elephants or buffaloes, frightened by lions, have suddenly fled in all directions.
'9': A king or a prince might be hunting in the forest, or it might be some other wild beast, O Saumitra, you should know.
'10': This mountain is difficult to traverse even for birds, O Lakshmana. You should quickly ascertain all this truthfully.
'11': Lakshmana, hastening, climbed a blossoming Sala tree and looked in all directions, first gazing towards the east.
'12': Looking northwards, he saw a great army, filled with chariots, horses, and elephants, well-arranged with foot soldiers.
'13': Seeing the army filled with horses and elephants, adorned with chariot banners, he reported to Rama and spoke these words.
'14': Let the noble one extinguish the fire, and Sita should enter the cave. String the bow and prepare the arrows and armor.
'15': 'Rama, the tiger among men, spoke to Lakshmana: O Saumitra, observe carefully, whose army do you think this is?'
'16': Thus addressed by Rama, Lakshmana spoke, as if desiring to burn that army, like a blazing fire.
'17': Desiring the kingdom, having clearly obtained the consecration, Bharata, the son of Kaikeyi, comes to kill us.
'18': This great, glorious tree with a tall trunk, the Kovidara banner, shines on the chariot.
'19': They ride swift horses as they please, and these riders shine, mounted on elephants, delighted.
'20': Let us, with bows in hand, take refuge in the mountain, or let us stand here, armed and ready for battle.
'21': Perhaps the one with the Kovidara banner will come under our control.
'22': May I see Bharata, for whose sake this great calamity has befallen you, O Raghava, and Sita and me as well.
'23': For whose sake you, O Raghava, have been deprived of the eternal kingdom, this enemy Bharata has come, and he is to be slain by me.
'24': I see no fault in killing Bharata, O Raghava. There is no sin in abandoning those who have previously harmed us.
'25': Bharata, who has previously harmed us and abandoned righteousness, O Raghava, having slain him, rule the entire earth.
'26': Today, Kaikeyi, desiring the kingdom, will see her son slain in battle by me, like a tree broken by an elephant, greatly distressed.
'27': I will kill Kaikeyi, along with her kin and relatives. Let the earth be freed from this great impurity today.
'28': Today, O honorable one, I will release this restrained anger and disrespect upon the enemy's army, like fire in the underbrush.
'29': Today, piercing the bodies of enemies with sharp arrows, I will make this forest of Chitrakuta soaked with blood.
'30': Let the wild beasts drag away the elephants and horses, their hearts pierced by arrows, and the men slain by me.
'31': I will be free of debt to the arrows and the bow in the great battle, having slain Bharata with his army, without a doubt.
'-1': Thus ends the ninety-sixth sarga named 'Lakshmana's Anger' in the Ayodhya Kanda of the holy Ramayana composed by Valmiki.
