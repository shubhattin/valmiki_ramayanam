'0': Thus begins the one hundred and eighth chapter, named "Jabali's Speech," in the Ayodhya Kanda of the sacred Ramayana composed by the sage Valmiki.
'1': The eminent Brahmin Jabali, while consoling Bharata, spoke these words to Rama, who is well-versed in dharma, though these words were devoid of dharma.
'2': O Raghava, let not your intellect be rendered futile like that of an ordinary man, for you possess the noble intellect of a wise person.
'3': Who is a relative to whom? What is to be gained by anyone from another? For a creature is born alone and perishes alone.
'4': Therefore, O Rama, one who considers 'this is my mother, this is my father' should be regarded as deluded, for truly, no one belongs to anyone.
'5': Just as a man traveling to another village may stay somewhere temporarily, leaving that place to move on the next day,
'6': In the same way, O descendant of Kakutstha, parents, home, and wealth are merely temporary abodes for humans; the wise do not attach themselves to them.
'7': Having abandoned the kingdom inherited from your father, you should not tread the difficult, thorny path of hardship, O best of men.
'8': In the prosperous city of Ayodhya, have yourself consecrated. The city, with its single braid, awaits you.
'9': Enjoy the royal pleasures, O son of the king, and roam in Ayodhya as Indra does in heaven.
'10': You are not related to Dasaratha, nor is he related to you. You are one king, and he was another. Therefore, do as you are told.
'11': The father is merely the seed of a being, the white and red fluids. The birth of a man here is due to the union with the mother during her fertile period.
'12': The king has gone to the place where he was destined to go. This is the way of mortals, yet you are unnecessarily grieving.
'13': I grieve for those who are devoted to wealth and dharma, not for others, for they, having suffered here, meet destruction after death.
'14': This populace, believing in the ancestral deities, offers food to the departed. See, what will a dead person eat?
'15': If what is eaten here by one goes to another's body, then one should offer oblations to those who are abroad, but that is not the case.
'16': These scriptures, composed by the wise, speak of charity and sacrifices. Perform sacrifices, give gifts, undertake vows, practice austerities, and renounce.
'17': O great-minded one, believe that there is nothing beyond this. Follow what is evident and keep what is unseen behind you.
'18': With this understanding, which is a guide for all the world, accept the kingdom, having been persuaded by Bharata.
'-1': Thus ends the one hundred and eighth chapter, named "Jabali's Speech," in the Ayodhya Kanda of the sacred Ramayana composed by the sage Valmiki.
