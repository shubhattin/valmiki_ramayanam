'0': Thus begins the sacred narration in the Valmiki Ramayana, in the Ayodhya Kanda, the tenth sarga entitled “The Chant of the Ikshvaku Dynasty.”
'1': Enraged by the command, Vasishtha addressed Rama, declaring, 'Even Jabali is well aware of the destined course of this world.'
'2': 'Wishing to put an end to further discussion, he spoke these words: ''O Lord of the universe, instruct me concerning the origin and creation of this world.'''
'3': It is said that the earth was originally fashioned entirely of water; thereafter, from a common source, Brahma—self-born and accompanied by the deities—assumed the form of a boar (Varāha) and uplifted the earth (Vasundhara).
'4': Then Brahma created the entire universe along with his own sons, having fashioned them from his very self; he, the originator of the sky, became eternal, imperishable, and unchanging.
'5': Hence, the illustrious Marichi was begotten, renowned among sages, as the son of Kashyapa.
'6': Likewise, Vivashvan—the offspring of Kashyapa—and Manu, the illustrious son of Vaivasvata, were born; Manu, as Prajapati, then begot Ikshvaku, marking the beginning of his eminent lineage.
'7': He was the first to be granted by the prosperous Manu to the earth; therefore, in Ayodhya, recognize him as the primordial king, known as Ikshvaku.
'8': Ikshvaku, celebrated by the epithet ‘Kukshi’, begot a son who came to be known as Vikukshi.
'9': Vikukshi, distinguished by his great brilliance, sired Bana—a son noted for his valor; and Bana’s progeny, the mighty-armed and illustrious Nara, became renowned in his days.
'10': Though varied rains prevailed in his time, severe famine afflicted even the virtuous; yet in the reign of the great King Anaranya, not even a single marauder was found.
'11': From King Anaranya arose the mighty-armed Prithu; hence the illustrious King Prithu, of the lineage of Trishanku, was born—he was a hero, steadfast in truth, and his form remained impervious.
'12': Trishanku’s son was Dhundhumara, a figure of great renown; and Dhundhumara, illustrious and brilliant, begot Yuvanasha.
'13': The son of Yuvanasha, known as the illustrious Maanadhata, was born; and Maanadhata, endowed with remarkable brilliance, begot Susandhi.
'14': Susandhi, too, had two sons—Dhruvasandhi and Prasenjit; and from Dhruvasandhi was sprung Bharata, celebrated as the vanquisher of foes.
'15': Bharata, the mighty-armed, begot a son named Rasito; from him subsequently arose those who opposed royal authority—the Haihayas, the Talajanghas, and the valorous Shashibindavas.
'16': Having arranged these forces in formation, the king set forth to engage in battle, while the sage, enraptured by the charm of a delightful mountain abode, remained ever devoted.
'17': It is recounted that he had two queens, both of whom were with child; and to one of them, for the purpose of effecting the end of an old lineage, he granted the birth of Sagara.
'18': Then Bhargava and Chyavana, who had taken refuge in the Himalayas, approached the venerable sage and offered their obeisance, extolling his virtues.
'19': In response, she extolled him before the revered Brahmin and subsequently, O goddess, she was blessed with a son—one who became a great soul, celebrated throughout the world for his virtue and piety, and who established a noble lineage as the conqueror of foes.
'20': Having performed a sacred circumambulation before the joyful sage—whose eyes shone like lotus leaves and whose countenance was radiant as one born of a lotus—the goddess returned to her home and gave birth to a son.
'21': To that queen, who ardently desired progeny, was granted a son through the act of conception; thus, by her alone, Sagara was born.
'22': That very King Sagara, renowned for having drawn up the ocean, swiftly traversed the mountains in such haste that his subjects were set in alarm.
'23': It is related that Sagara had a son whose nature was incongruous; though he survived, his actions, steeped in unrighteousness, led to his disownment by his father.
'24': Anshuman, too, was born—though in certain respects ungainly, he was endowed with valour; and from Dilipa, the son of Ashumata, emerged Bhagiratha.
'25': From Bhagiratha sprang Kakutstha, a name celebrated in lore; and from Kakutstha was born his son Raghu, the progenitor of the great Raghu dynasty.
'26': Raghu’s son, illustrious and vigorous, was known as Kalmaṣapada, who came to be famed on earth by the name Saudasa.
'27': The son of Kalmaṣapada, celebrated as Shankhaṇa, distinguished himself by exhibiting formidable valour, subduing an army numbering a hundred thousand.
'28': Shankhaṇa’s son was the valorous and illustrious Sudarshana; and from him was born Agnivarna, and thence, the swift one named Shrighra.
'29': Shrighra begot Maru, whose son was Prashushruka; and from Prashushruka was born Ambariṣa, renowned for his magnificent brilliance.
'30': From Ambariṣa was born Nahusha, celebrated for his true valour; and from Nahusha came Nabhaga, a son distinguished by his supreme piety.
'31': Along with Nabhaga, two sons—Aj and Suvrata—were born; and of Aj emerged the virtuous King Dasharatha.
'32': His eldest, known as Dayado and celebrated as Rama, is renowned; therefore, O king, assume your rightful kingdom and look upon your people.
'33': For among all the Ikshvaku dynasty, the king stands as the ancestral progenitor; and his eldest son, Nara, is duly anointed as the ruler.
'34': Thou, upholder of the eternal duties of the Raghu lineage, ought never to violate the venerable customs of thy forefathers; for by adhering to the illustrious jewels of your ancestry, you are destined to preserve the sacred land and the great nation of your paternal heritage.
'-1': Thus, in the Valmiki Ramayana, the ancient epic, within the Ayodhya Kanda, concludes the tenth sarga entitled “The Chant of the Ikshvaku Dynasty.”
