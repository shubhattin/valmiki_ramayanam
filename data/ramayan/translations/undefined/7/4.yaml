'0': Thus begins the fourth chapter of the Uttarakanda of the sacred Ramayana composed by the sage Valmiki, which narrates the origin of Ravana and other ancient Rakshasas.
'1': Hearing the words spoken by Agastya, Rama was filled with wonder. He asked, "How did the Rakshasas come to exist in Lanka in ancient times?"
'2': Then, shaking his head, resembling the sacrificial fire, Rama, smiling, addressed Agastya repeatedly.
'3': '"O revered one, I have heard that Lanka was once inhabited by flesh-eating Rakshasas. Hearing your words, I am filled with great wonder."'
'4': '"We have heard that the Rakshasas were born from the lineage of Pulastya. But now you have mentioned another origin."'
'5': '"Are they stronger than Ravana, Kumbhakarna, Prahasta, Vikata, and the sons of Ravana?"'
'6': '"Who is their ancestor, O Brahman? What is his name, and how was he endowed with great strength? What offense did they commit to be driven away by Vishnu?"'
'7': '"Please narrate all this to me in detail, O sinless one. Satisfy my curiosity as the sun dispels darkness."'
'8': Hearing the auspicious and well-ornamented words of Raghava, Agastya, slightly amazed, spoke to Raghava.
'9': In ancient times, the progenitor of beings, born of water, created the waters. From them, he created beings for their protection, born of the lotus.
'10': Those beings approached the creator of beings with humility, afflicted by hunger, thirst, and fear, asking, "What should we do?"
'11': The progenitor of beings, smiling, addressed them with words, saying, "Protect," thus granting them honor.
'12': Some said, "We shall protect," while others said, "We shall eat." Then the creator of beings addressed them.
'13': Those who said, "We shall protect," became Rakshasas, and those who said, "We shall eat," became Yakshas.
'14': Among them, Heti and Praheti, two brothers, became the lords of the Rakshasas, resembling Madhu and Kaitabha, the subduers of enemies.
'15': Among them, Praheti was righteous and went to the forest for penance, while Heti made great efforts for marriage.
'16': The wise Heti, of immeasurable soul, married a maiden named Bhaya, the sister of Kala, who was fearsome.
'17': From her, Heti, the foremost of Rakshasas, begot a son named Vidyutkesa, known as the best among sons.
'18': Vidyutkesa, the son of Heti, with a brilliance equal to the blazing sun, grew up with great splendor, like a cloud in the midst of water.
'19': When the night-wanderer reached youth, his father decided to arrange his marriage.
'20': Heti, the foremost of Rakshasas, sought the daughter of Sandhya, equal in splendor to Sandhya, for his son.
'21': Sandhya, thinking that her daughter must be given to another, gave her daughter to Vidyutkesa, O Raghava.
'22': Having obtained the daughter of Sandhya, Vidyutkesa, the night-wanderer, enjoyed with her, like Maghavan with Paulomi.
'23': In due course, O Rama, Salakatankata conceived from Vidyutkesa, like a line of clouds from the ocean.
'24': Then that Rakshasi, bearing a fetus with a brilliance equal to a cloud, gave birth on Mandara, like Ganga giving birth to Agni's fetus.
'25': Having abandoned the fetus, seeking pleasure with Vidyutkesa, she forgot her son, absorbed in enjoyment with her husband.
'26': The abandoned fetus, with a sound like thunder, was left there. The child, with a radiance like the autumn sun, placed his fist in his mouth and cried softly.
'27': Then, mounted on a bull, accompanied by Parvati, Shiva, traveling through the path of the wind, heard the sound of crying.
'28': Seeing the Rakshasa child crying with Uma, Bhava, the destroyer of Tripura, was moved by compassion.
'29': He made the Rakshasa child equal in age to his mother, and made him immortal, imperishable, and eternal.
'30': To please Parvati, he gave the child a city in the sky. Uma also granted a boon to the Rakshasas, O prince.
'31': The immediate attainment of the fetus, immediate birth, and immediate attainment of age, equal to the age of the mother.
'32': Then, filled with pride from the boon, Sukesha, having obtained the splendor of the lord, wandered everywhere, having obtained the city of the sky, like Purandara.
'-1': Thus ends the fourth chapter of the Uttarakanda of the sacred Ramayana composed by the sage Valmiki, which narrates the origin of Ravana and other ancient Rakshasas.
