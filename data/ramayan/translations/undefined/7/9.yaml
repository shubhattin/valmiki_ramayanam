'0': Now begins the ninth chapter, named 'The Origin of Ravana', in the Uttarakanda of the sacred Ramayana composed by the sage Valmiki.
'1': After some time, a Rakshasa named Sumali wandered from the netherworld to the mortal realm.
'2': Resembling a dark cloud, adorned with golden earrings, he carried his daughter, like prosperity without the lotus.
'3': As the lord of the Rakshasas roamed the earth, he saw Kubera traveling in the Pushpaka Vimana.
'4': Kubera, the son of the sage Pulastya, was going to visit his father. Seeing him, Sumali, amazed, returned to the netherworld.
'5': The wise Rakshasa pondered, 'What should be done for our welfare? How can we prosper?'
'6': He then spoke to his daughter, named Kaikesi, 'Daughter, the time for your marriage has come, and your youth is passing by.
'7': Due to fear of rejection, you are not being accepted by suitors. For your sake, we are all restrained by righteousness.
'8': You are endowed with all virtues, like the goddess of fortune herself, O daughter. The fatherhood of a daughter is indeed distressing for those who desire honor.
'9': It is not known who will choose you as a bride, O maiden.
'10': You are endowed with all virtues, like the goddess of fortune herself, O daughter. The family of the mother, the family of the father, and the family where she is given, a maiden always places these three families in doubt.
'11': Therefore, seek the great sage Vishrava, born in the lineage of Prajapati, and choose him yourself, O daughter.
'12': Such sons will be born to you, O daughter, without a doubt, who will be like the sun in brilliance, like this lord of wealth.
'13': Hearing these words, the maiden, out of respect for her father, went to where Vishrava was performing penance.
'14': Meanwhile, O Rama, the sage Pulastya's son was engaged in the Agnihotra, like the fourth fire.
'15': Without considering the harsh time, out of respect for her father, she approached him and stood before him, with her head bowed, repeatedly scratching the ground with her toe.
'16': Seeing her, with a face like the full moon, the noble sage, shining with his own brilliance, spoke to her.
'17': '''O auspicious one, whose daughter are you? From where have you come here? What is your purpose? For what reason? Tell me truthfully, O beautiful one.'''
'18': Thus addressed, the maiden, with folded hands, spoke, 'O sage, you should know my intention by your own power.
'19': But know me, O Brahmarshi, as having come by my father's command. I am named Kaikesi, the rest you should know.'
'20': The sage, having gone into meditation, spoke these words, 'I have understood your mind's intention, O auspicious one.
'21': You desire sons from me, O one with the gait of a royal elephant. Since you have approached me at this harsh time,
'22': hear therefore, O auspicious one, the kind of sons you will bear. They will be fierce, with dreadful forms, and dear to those of dreadful lineage.
'23': You will give birth to Rakshasas of cruel deeds, O one with beautiful hips.' Hearing these words, she bowed and spoke.
'24': '''O revered one, I do not wish for such sons from you, O knower of Brahman. You should show me favor.'''
'25': Thus addressed by the maiden, the foremost sage Vishrava spoke again to Kaikesi, like the full moon to Rohini.
'26': '''Your last son, O auspicious one, will be righteous and will befit my lineage.'''
'27': Thus addressed, the maiden, in due course, gave birth to a terrifying Rakshasa, dreadful in form.
'28': He had ten heads, great fangs, and was like a mass of dark collyrium, with coppery lips, twenty arms, a huge mouth, and blazing hair.
'29': At the time of his birth, jackals with flaming mouths howled, and carnivorous birds circled counterclockwise.
'30': Blood rained from the sky, clouds roared harshly, the sun did not shine, and great meteors fell to the earth.
'31': The earth trembled, fierce winds blew, and the ocean, lord of rivers, was agitated.
'32': Then his father, equal to the grandsire, named him Dashagriva, saying, 'This one with ten necks is born.'
'33': After him was born the mighty Kumbhakarna, whose size was immense, unmatched in this world.
'34': Then was born a daughter named Shurpanakha, with a deformed face, and Vibhishana, the righteous, was the last son of Kaikesi.
'35': At his birth, a shower of flowers fell.
'36': Drums resounded in the sky, and the gods exclaimed, 'Well done, well done!'
'37': The two, Kumbhakarna and Dashagriva, grew up in that great forest, causing fear in the world.
'38': Kumbhakarna, intoxicated, devoured the three worlds, always unsatisfied, wandering about.
'39': Vibhishana, the righteous, was always devoted to righteousness, engaged in self-study, with controlled diet, and subdued senses.
'40': Then, at some time, the god Vaishravana, the lord of wealth, came to see his father, traveling in the Pushpaka Vimana.
'41': Seeing him there, Kaikesi, blazing with brilliance, approached the Rakshasa and spoke to Dashagriva.
'42': '''Son, behold Vaishravana, your brother, endowed with splendor. Consider yourself equal to him in brotherhood.'''
'43': '''O Dashagriva, make efforts, O one of immense prowess, so that you, my son, become like Vaishravana.'''
'44': Hearing his mother's words, the mighty Dashagriva was filled with unparalleled anger and made a vow.
'45': '''I promise you, I will become equal to or greater than my brother in strength. Abandon the sorrow in your heart.'''
'46': Then, with that anger, Dashagriva, along with his younger brother, resolved to perform a difficult task, with his mind set on penance.
'47': Determined to achieve his desire through penance, he went to the auspicious hermitage of Gokarna for self-realization.
'48': There, the Rakshasa, with his younger brother, performed intense penance, with unmatched valor, and pleased the lord, the grandsire, who granted them boons.
'-1': Thus ends the ninth chapter, named 'The Origin of Ravana', in the Uttarakanda of the sacred Ramayana composed by the sage Valmiki.
