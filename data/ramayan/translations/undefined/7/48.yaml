'0': Thus begins the forty-eighth chapter, named 'The Abandonment of Sita', in the Uttarakanda of the sacred Ramayana composed by the sage Valmiki.
'1': Hearing the harsh words of Lakshmana, the daughter of Janaka, Sita, was overcome with great sorrow and fell to the ground.
'2': For a moment, she lay there unconscious, her eyes filled with tears. Then, with a voice full of despair, she spoke to Lakshmana.
'3': '"O Lakshmana, surely this body of mine was created for suffering, for today I appear as the very embodiment of sorrow."'
'4': '"What sin did I commit in a previous life, or who was separated from their spouse, that I, though pure and virtuous, am abandoned by the king?"'
'5': '"In the past, I lived in the hermitage, following the footsteps of Rama, enduring hardships, O son of Sumitra."'
'6': '"How can I, O gentle one, live in the hermitage, abandoned and alone? To whom shall I tell my sorrow, being one who is devoted to sorrow?"'
'7': '"What shall I say to the sages, or what virtuous deed have I done, that I am abandoned by the great-souled Rama for some reason?"'
'8': '"Indeed, O son of Sumitra, I would not give up my life in the waters of the Ganges today, for the royal lineage of my husband would be ridiculed."'
'9': '"As you have been commanded, O son of Sumitra, abandon me, the one who shares in sorrow. Obey the king''s command, but hear my words."'
'10': '"With folded hands and bowed head, convey my respects to my mothers-in-law and inform the king of their well-being."'
'11': '"With a bowed head, convey my respects to all of them, O Lakshmana. The king, who is well-versed in dharma, should also be informed."'
'12': '"You know, O Raghava, that Sita is pure in essence, devoted with supreme devotion, and always beneficial to you."'
'13': '"I am abandoned by you, O hero, fearing disgrace among the people. Whatever words arise from slander, I must avoid them, for you are my ultimate refuge."'
'14': '"The king, who is well-versed in dharma, should be informed that as you conduct yourself with your brothers, so should you always conduct yourself with the citizens."'
'15': '"For this is your supreme dharma, and hence your unparalleled fame."'
'16': '"Whatever the citizens, O king, may attain through dharma, I do not grieve for my own body, O best of men."'
'17': '"As per the reproach of the citizens, O descendant of Raghu, the husband is indeed the deity, the husband is the kin, the husband is the guru for a woman."'
'18': '"Therefore, even with one''s life, the beloved task of the husband should be done, especially. Thus, Rama should be informed of my resolve. Now, you go, for I have passed the time of my season."'
'19': As Sita was speaking thus, Lakshmana, with a sorrowful heart, bowed his head to the ground and was unable to speak.
'20': Circumambulating her, he wept loudly, and after contemplating for a moment, he said, "What will you say to me, O auspicious one?"
'21': '"I have not seen your form before, nor have I seen your feet, O sinless one. How do I see you here, bereft of Rama, in the forest?"'
'22': Having said this, he bowed to her and again boarded the boat. After boarding the boat, he urged the boatman.
'23': Reaching the northern shore, burdened with grief, he, as if bewildered by sorrow, quickly ascended the chariot.
'24': Turning back repeatedly, seeing Sita, who appeared helpless, standing on the opposite shore, Lakshmana then departed.
'25': Seeing the chariot from a distance and Lakshmana repeatedly, Sita, filled with anxiety, was overcome with grief.
'26': Bent under the weight of sorrow, the illustrious and virtuous Sita, not seeing her lord, wept loudly in the forest, echoing with the cries of peacocks, devoted to sorrow.
'-1': Thus ends the forty-eighth chapter, named 'The Abandonment of Sita', in the Uttarakanda of the sacred Ramayana composed by the sage Valmiki.
