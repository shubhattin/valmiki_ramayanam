'0': In the sacred Ramayana composed by the sage Valmiki, in the Uttarakanda, this is the thirty-fifth sarga, named 'The Birth of Hanuman'.
'1': Then, with folded hands and filled with humility, Rama asked the sage of the southern hermitage, speaking these meaningful words.
'2': '"The strength of Vali and Ravana is indeed incomparable, yet I believe that neither of them is equal to Hanuman."'
'3': '"Valor, skill, strength, courage, wisdom, and the means of strategy, along with prowess and influence, have made their abode in Hanuman."'
'4': '"Upon seeing the ocean and the despondent army of monkeys, the mighty-armed Hanuman consoled them and leaped across a hundred yojanas."'
'5': '"Having entered the city of Lanka and Ravana''s inner chambers, he saw and conversed with Sita, offering her solace."'
'6': '"The leaders of the army, the ministers'' sons, the Kinkaras, and Ravana''s son were all slain by Hanuman alone at that time."'
'7': '"After being freed from captivity, he spoke to the ten-headed Ravana, and by him, Lanka was reduced to ashes, like the earth by fire."'
'8': '"Neither the deeds of Time, nor of Indra, nor of Vishnu, nor of Kubera are heard of in battle like those of Hanuman."'
'9': '"By the strength of his arms, Lanka, Sita, and Lakshmana were recovered by me, along with victory, the kingdom, friends, and relatives."'
'10': '"If Hanuman were not the friend of the king of monkeys, who would have been capable of knowing the whereabouts of Janaki?"'
'11': '"Why was it that when enmity arose due to Sugriva''s desire to please, the creepers were not burnt like in the case of Vali?"'
'12': '"I believe Hanuman did not know his own strength, as he saw the king of monkeys suffering, though he desired life."'
'13': '"O revered one, tell me in detail and truthfully about the great-minded Hanuman, who is worshipped by the immortals."'
'14': Hearing the reasoned words of Raghava, the sage then spoke these words in the presence of Hanuman.
'15': '"O best of the Raghus, what you say about Hanuman is true. None is equal to him in strength, speed, or intellect."'
'16': '"Cursed by the sages with infallible curses, he was given the boon of not knowing his own strength, though he is powerful and a crusher of foes."'
'17': '"Even in his childhood, the mighty Hanuman performed deeds that cannot be described due to his childishness."'
'18': '"If you have the desire to hear, O Raghava, then listen attentively as I narrate it to you."'
'19': '"There is a mountain named Sumeru, adorned with golden peaks given by the sun, where his father Kesari rules."'
'20': '"His wife, known as Anjana, gave birth to the excellent son of the wind-god in her."'
'21': '"Anjana, desiring to gather fruits, went out into the forest, and there she gave birth to him, who shone like a grain of rice."'
'22': '"Separated from his mother and tormented by hunger, the infant cried excessively, like a child in a thicket."'
'23': '"Then, seeing the rising sun, resembling a cluster of hibiscus flowers, he leaped towards it out of a desire for fruit."'
'24': '"The child, facing the young sun, appeared like a young sun himself, desiring to grasp the young sun, he soared into the sky."'
'25': '"As Hanuman, in his childlike state, was leaping, a great wonder arose among the gods, demons, and yakshas."'
'26': '"Neither the wind, nor Garuda, nor the mind is as swift as this son of the wind, who traverses the sky excellently."'
'27': '"If the speed and prowess of this child are such, what will his speed be when he attains youth and strength?"'
'28': '"The wind followed his leaping son, protecting him from the sun''s heat, cooling him with a mass of frost."'
'29': '"Traversing many thousands of yojanas, he reached the proximity of the sun due to his father''s strength and his own childhood."'
'30': '"The sun, considering him a faultless child, did not burn him, thinking that his task was also dependent on him."'
'31': '"On the very day he leaped to grasp the sun, Rahu sought to seize the sun."'
'32': '"Touched by him on the chariot of the sun, Rahu, the tormentor of the moon and sun, fled in fear."'
'33': '"Going to the abode of Indra, the son of Simhika, with a frown, spoke to the god surrounded by the hosts of gods."'
'34': '"Having given me the removal of hunger by seizing the moon and sun, O Vasava, why have you given it to another, O slayer of Vritra?"'
'35': '"Today, at the time of the eclipse, I came to seize the sun, but another, reaching before me, seized the sun."'
'36': '"Hearing the words of Rahu, Vasava, filled with agitation, rose from his seat, wearing a golden garland."'
'37': '"Then, mounting the elephant resembling the peak of Kailasa, with four tusks, exuding ichor, adorned with ornaments, tall, and laughing with golden bells,"'
'38': '"Indra, having made Rahu his vanguard, proceeded to where the sun was, along with Hanuman."'
'39': '"Then, with great speed, Rahu, leaving Vasava, was seen by him, rushing like a mountain peak."'
'40': '"Then, leaving the sun and seeing Rahu as a fruit, he leaped again into the sky to seize the son of Simhika."'
'41': '"Leaving the sun, this monkey, rushing, seeing him thus, turned back, with only his face remaining forward."'
'42': '"Rahu, hoping for Indra as his protector, repeatedly cried out ''Indra, Indra'' in fear."'
'43': '"Hearing the voice of Rahu, already recognized, Indra said, ''Do not fear, I will destroy him.''"'
'44': '"Then, seeing Airavata, thinking it a great fruit, he rushed towards the king of elephants."'
'45': '"Thus, as he rushed to seize Airavata, his form became terrible for a moment, like that of Indra and Agni."'
'46': '"Thus rushing, the lord of Shachi, not excessively angry, struck him with a thunderbolt released from his hand."'
'47': '"Then, struck by Indra''s thunderbolt, he fell on a mountain, and as he fell, his left jaw was broken."'
'48': '"When the child, struck by the thunderbolt, fell, the wind, for the harm of beings, became angry with Indra."'
'49': '"Restraining his movement, the lord of beings entered a cave, taking his child with him."'
'50': '"Blocking the passage of excrement and urine, he caused great distress to beings, like women in the inner chambers."'
'51': '"Due to the wind''s wrath, beings, deprived of breath, became like pieces of wood, breaking at the joints."'
'52': '"Devoid of the recitation of the Vedas and sacrificial exclamations, without rituals, and bereft of dharma, the three worlds became like hell due to the wind''s wrath."'
'53': '"Then, the beings, along with the Gandharvas, gods, demons, and humans, approached the lord of beings, desiring happiness."'
'54': '"The gods, with bellies like great pots, with folded hands, said, ''O lord, you indeed created the fourfold beings.''"'
'55': '"You gave us the wind as the lord of life, and now, being the lord of breath, why has he today, O best of beings,"'
'56': '"caused us distress, like women in the inner chambers? Therefore, we have come to you for refuge, struck by the wind."'
'57': '"Hearing this from the beings, the lord of beings, Prajapati, said, ''This is due to a reason,'' and then spoke again to the beings."'
'58': '"Listen to the reason why the wind became angry and restrained the beings, which is worthy of being heard and forgiving to oneself."'
'59': '"His son was struck down today by the lord of the gods, Indra, following the words of Rahu, and thus the wind became angry."'
'60': '"The wind, though bodiless, moves within bodies, sustaining them, for without the wind, the body becomes like wood."'
'61': '"The wind is life, the wind is happiness, the wind is everything in this world. Deprived of the wind, the world finds no happiness."'
'62': '"Today, the world, deprived of the wind, the lord of life, is like wooden walls, standing without breath."'
'63': '"Therefore, let us go to where the wind, the giver of pain to us, resides, lest we perish without appeasing the son of Aditi."'
'64': '"Then, accompanied by the beings, Prajapati, along with the gods, Gandharvas, serpents, and Guhyakas, went to where the wind, holding his son struck by the lord of the gods, was staying."'
'65': '"Then, seeing the son, lying on the lap of the ever-present wind, shining like the sun, fire, and gold, the four-faced one showed compassion, along with the gods, Gandharvas, sages, yakshas, and rakshasas."'
'-1': Thus ends the thirty-fifth sarga, named 'The Birth of Hanuman', in the Uttarakanda of the sacred Ramayana composed by the sage Valmiki.
