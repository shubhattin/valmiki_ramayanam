'0': Now begins the eleventh chapter, named 'Ravana's Arrival in Lanka', of the Uttarakanda of the sacred Ramayana composed by Valmiki.
'1': Sumali, upon learning that these night-stalkers had obtained boons, rose up from the netherworld, casting aside fear, along with his followers.
'2': Maricha, Prahasta, Virupaksha, and Mahodara, the ministers of the demon, also rose up, filled with great enthusiasm.
'3': Sumali, surrounded by the foremost of demons and accompanied by his ministers, approached Ravana and embraced him, speaking thus.
'4': '"By good fortune, O child, this cherished desire of yours has been fulfilled, for you have obtained the supreme boon from the best of the three worlds.'
'5': For the sake of which we had abandoned Lanka and descended to the netherworld, that great fear caused by Vishnu has now been dispelled, O mighty-armed one.
'6': Frightened repeatedly by that fear, we abandoned our abode and fled together, entering the netherworld.
'7': This city of Lanka, suitable for demons, was established by your wise brother, the treasurer of wealth.
'8': If it is possible to reclaim it through conciliation, gifts, or even by force, O mighty-armed one, let it be done.
'9': You shall undoubtedly become the lord of Lanka, O dear one. You will uplift this demon race, even if it is submerged. You will become the lord of us all, O mighty one.
'10': Then Ravana, addressing his maternal grandfather who had arrived, said, "Our guru, the lord of wealth, should not speak thus.
'11': Even though the king of demons, superior in power, rejected conciliation, the demon did not say anything, knowing his intention.
'12': After some time, a night-stalker spoke to Ravana, who was residing there, addressing him with these words.
'13': Prahasta, with respectful words, spoke this reasoned speech.
'14': '"O mighty-armed Ravana, you should not speak thus. There is no brotherhood among the valiant. Listen to my words.'
'15': Aditi and Diti, the two sisters, were the wives of the progenitor Kashyapa, and they were of supreme beauty.
'16': Aditi gave birth to the gods, the lords of the three worlds, while Diti gave birth to sons, equal to Kashyapa in nature.
'17': The city of the Daityas, known for its righteousness, was surrounded by the ocean and mountains, and they were powerful.
'18': Having slain them in battle, Vishnu, the powerful one, brought this imperishable three worlds under the control of the gods.
'19': You alone will not be able to reverse this, which has been accomplished by the gods and demons. Follow my advice.
'20': Thus addressed, Ravana, with a delighted heart, thought for a moment and then said, "So be it."
'21': With that same joy, on that day, the valiant Ravana went to the forest with those night-stalkers.
'22': Then, stationed on Trikuta, the night-stalker Ravana sent Prahasta, skilled in speech, as a messenger.
'23': '"Prahasta, go quickly and speak to the foremost of the Rakshasas, conveying my words to the lord of wealth, beginning with conciliation.'
'24': This city of Lanka, O king, was established by you for the great-souled Rakshasas. It is not proper for you, O sinless one.
'25': If today, O one of incomparable valor, you would give it to us, my joy would be fulfilled, and the burden would be relieved.
'26': Having gone to the city of Lanka, protected by the lord of wealth, he spoke these words to the most generous treasurer.
'27': '"I have been sent by your brother, the virtuous Ravana, to your presence, O mighty-armed one, the best among those who wield weapons.'
'28': Listen, O wise one, skilled in all scriptures, to the words of Ravana, O lord of wealth, which I speak.
'29': This delightful city was once enjoyed by the Rakshasas, led by Sumali, who were of terrible valor.
'30': Therefore, O son of Vishrava, he requests you now, with conciliation, to give this city, O dear one.
'31': Having heard the words of Prahasta, the god Vaishravana, skilled in speech, replied to him.
'32': This Lanka was given to me by my father, devoid of night-stalkers, and I have settled it with Yakshas, endowed with gifts and virtues.
'33': Go and tell Ravana, "The city and kingdom that are mine, O mighty-armed one, you too enjoy this kingdom without hindrance."
'34': Having spoken thus, the treasurer went to his father's presence.
'35': Having saluted his guru, he spoke of Ravana's desire, "This Ravana, O father, has sent a messenger to me.
'36': Let the city of Lanka, formerly inhabited by the Rakshasa hosts, be given. Tell me, O virtuous one, what should be done here by me."
'37': Thus addressed, the sage Vishrava, the foremost of sages, spoke to the treasurer, "Listen, O son, to my words.
'38': Ravana, the mighty-armed, spoke in my presence, and I rebuked him, having spoken many harsh words to that wicked-minded one.
'39': I spoke to him in anger, and he was repeatedly destroyed. Listen, O son, to the righteous and beneficial words I speak.
'40': Deluded by the boon, that wicked-minded one does not know the honorable from the dishonorable, and due to my curse, he has gone to a dreadful state.
'41': Therefore, O mighty-armed one, go to Mount Kailasa, the mountain of the earth, and establish your residence, leaving Lanka with your followers.
'42': There, the delightful Mandakini, the best of rivers, flows, covered with golden lotuses, shining like the sun.
'43': With lotuses, water lilies, and other fragrant flowers.
'44': There, the gods, along with Gandharvas, Apsaras, Nagas, and Kinnaras, always enjoy themselves, constantly residing there.
'45': It is not proper for you to have enmity with the Rakshasa, O treasurer, for you know that he has obtained the supreme boon.
'46': Thus addressed, taking his father's words quickly out of respect, he went with his wife, children, followers, and wealth.
'47': Then Prahasta, with a delighted heart, spoke to Ravana, the great-souled one, along with his ministers and younger brother.
'48': That city of Lanka is now empty, having been abandoned by the treasurer. Enter it with us and uphold your duty.
'49': Thus addressed by Prahasta, the mighty Ravana entered the city of Lanka with his brothers and followers.
'50': Having been abandoned by the treasurer, with well-divided great roads, he ascended it like the lord of the gods ascending heaven.
'51': Then, consecrated by the night-stalkers, Ravana established the city, and it became filled with night-stalkers, like dark clouds.
'52': The lord of wealth, out of respect for his father's words, established a city on the pure mountain, adorned with splendid palaces, like Amaravati of the lord of the gods.
'-1': Thus ends the eleventh chapter, named 'Ravana's Arrival in Lanka', of the Uttarakanda of the sacred Ramayana composed by Valmiki.
